2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.
To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:
Charlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I have the job of managing a portion of your savings. We are
honored by your trust.
Our position carries with it the responsibility to report to you what we would like to know if wewere the
absentee owner and you were the manager. We enjoy communicating directly with you through this annual letter, and
through the annual meeting as well.
Our policy is to treat all shareholders equally. Therefore, we do not hold discussions with analysts nor large
institutions. Whenever possible, also, we release important communications on Saturday mornings in order tomaximize the time for shareholders and the media to absorb the news before markets open on Monday.
A wealth of Berkshire facts and figures are set forth in the annual 10-K that the company regularly files with
the S.E.C. and that we reproduce on pages K-1 – K-119. Some shareholders will find this detail engrossing; otherswill simply prefer to learn what Charlie and I believe is new or interesting at Berkshire.
Alas, there was little action of that sort in 2021. We did, though, make reasonable progress in increasing the
intrinsic value of your shares. That task has been my primary duty for 57 years. And it will continue to be.
What You Own
Berkshire owns a wide variety of businesses, some in their entirety, some only in part. The second group
largely consists of marketable common stocks of major American companies. Additionally, we own a few non-U.S.equities and participate in several joint ventures or other collaborative activities.
Whatever our form of ownership, our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesses with both durable
economic advantages and a first-class CEO. Please note particularly that we own stocks based upon our expectationsabout their long-term business performance and notbecause we view them as vehicles for timely market moves. That
point is crucial: Charlie and I are notstock-pickers; we are business-pickers.
I make many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses includes some enterprises that
have truly extraordinary economics, many others that enjoy good economic characteristics, and a few that aremarginal. One advantage of our common-stock segment is that – on occasion – it becomes easy to buy pieces of
wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. That shooting-fish-in-a-barrel experience is very rare in negotiated
transactions and never occurs en masse . It is also far easier to exit from a mistake when it has been made in the
marketable arena.
3Surprise, Surprise
Here are a few items about your company that often surprise even seasoned investors:
• Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth,
Berkshire owns and operates more U.S.-based “infrastructure” assets – classified on our balance sheet as
property, plant and equipment – than are owned and operated by any other American corporation. That
supremacy has never been our goal. It has, however, become a fact.
At yearend, those domestic infrastructure assets were carried on Berkshire’s balance sheet at $158 billion.
That number increased last year and will continue to increase. Berkshire always will be building.
• Every year, your company makes substantial federal income tax payments. In 2021, for example, we paid
$3.3 billion while the U.S. Treasury reported total corporate income-tax receipts of $402 billion.
Additionally, Berkshire pays substantial state and foreign taxes. “I gave at the office” is an unassailableassertion when made by Berkshire shareholders.
Berkshire’s history vividly illustrates the invisible and often unrecognized financial partnership between
government and American businesses. Our tale begins early in 1955, when Berkshire Fine Spinning andHathaway Manufacturing agreed to merge their businesses. In their requests for shareholder approval, thesevenerable New England textile companies expressed high hopes for the combination.
The Hathaway solicitation, for example, assured its shareholders that “The combination of the resources and
managements will result in one of the strongest and most efficient organizations in the textile industry.” Thatupbeat view was endorsed by the company’s advisor, Lehman Brothers (yes, that Lehman Brothers).
I’m sure it was a joyous day in both Fall River (Berkshire) and New Bedford (Hathaway) when the union
was consummated. After the bands stopped playing and the bankers went home, however, the shareholdersreaped a disaster.
In the nine years following the merger, Berkshire’s owners watched the company’s net worth crater from
$51.4 million to $22.1 million. In part, this decline was caused by stock repurchases, ill-advised dividendsand plant shutdowns. But nine years of effort by many thousands of employees delivered an operating lossas well. Berkshire’s struggles were not unusual: The New England textile industry had silently entered anextended and non-reversible death march.
During the nine post-merger years, the U.S. Treasury suffered as well from Berkshire’s troubles. All told, the
company paid the government only $337,359 in income tax during that period – a pathetic $100 per day .
Early in 1965, things changed. Berkshire installed new management that redeployed available cash and
steered essentially allearnings into a variety of good businesses, most of which remained good through the
years. Coupling reinvestment of earnings with the power of compounding worked its magic, and shareholdersprospered.
Berkshire’s owners, it should be noted, were not the only beneficiary of that course correction. Their “silent
partner,” the U.S. Treasury, proceeded to collect many tens of billions of dollars from the company in income
tax payments. Remember the $100 daily? Now, Berkshire pays roughly $9 million daily to the Treasury.
4In fairness to our governmental partner, our shareholders should acknowledge – indeed trumpet – the fact
that Berkshire’s prosperity has been fostered mightily because the company has operated in America. Our
country would have done splendidly in the years since 1965 without Berkshire. Absent our American home,
however, Berkshire would never have come close to becoming what it is today. When you see the flag, saythanks.
• From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader in
insurance “float” – money we hold and can invest but that does not belong to us. Including a relatively small
sum derived from life insurance, Berkshire’s total float has grown from $19 million when we entered the
insurance business to $147 billion .
So far, this float has cost us less than nothing. Though we have experienced a number of years when insurance
losses combined with operating expenses exceeded premiums, overall we have earned a modest 55-year
profit from the underwriting activities that generated our float.
Of equal importance, float is very sticky. Funds attributable to our insurance operations come and go daily,
but their aggregate total is immune from precipitous decline. When it comes to investing float, we cantherefore think long-term.
If you are not already familiar with the concept of float, I refer you to a long explanation on page A-5. To
my surprise, our float increased $9 billion last year, a buildup of value that is important to Berkshire ownersthough is not reflected in our GAAP (“generally-accepted accounting principles”) presentation of earnings
and net worth.
Much of our huge value creation in insurance is attributable to Berkshire’s good luck in my 1986 hiring of
Ajit Jain. We first met on a Saturday morning, and I quickly asked Ajit what his insurance experience hadbeen. He replied, “None.”
I said, “Nobody’s perfect,” and hired him. That was my lucky day: Ajit actually was as perfect a choice as
could have been made. Better yet, he continues to be – 35 years later.
One final thought about insurance: I believe that it is likely – but farfrom assured – that Berkshire’s float
can be maintained without our incurring a long-term underwriting loss. I am certain , however, that there will
be some years when we experience such losses, perhaps involving very large sums.
Berkshire is constructed to handle catastrophic events as no other insurer – and that priority will remain long
after Charlie and I are gone.
Our Four Giants
Through Berkshire, our shareholders own many dozens of businesses. Some of these, in turn, have a
collection of subsidiaries of their own. For example, Marmon has more than 100 individual business operations,ranging from the leasing of railroad cars to the manufacture of medical devices.
• Nevertheless, operations of our “Big Four” companies account for a very large chunk of Berkshire’s value.
Leading this list is our cluster of insurers. Berkshire effectively owns 100% of this group, whose massivefloat value we earlier described. The invested assets of these insurers are further enlarged by the extraordinaryamount of capital we invest to back up their promises.
5The insurance business is made to order for Berkshire. The product will never be obsolete, and sales volume
will generally increase along with both economic growth and inflation. Also, integrity and capital will foreverbe important. Our company can and will behave well.
There are, of course, other insurers with excellent business models and prospects. Replication of Berkshire’s
operation, however, would be almost impossible.
• Apple – our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value – is a different sort of holding. Here,
our ownership is a mere 5.55%, up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. Butconsider that each 0.1% of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million . We spent noBerkshire funds
to gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job.
It’s important to understand that only dividends from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire
reports – and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amountedto a staggering $5.6 billion . Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an act
we applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his firstlove, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well.
• BNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it an
indispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries wereinstead hauled by truck, America’s carbon emissions would soar.
Your railroad had record earnings of $6 billion in 2021. Here, it should be noted, we are talking about the
old-fashioned sort of earnings that we favor: a figure calculated after interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization and all forms of compensation. (Our definition suggests a warning: Deceptive “adjustments” toearnings – to use a polite description – have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks haverisen. Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull . . ..)
BNSF trains traveled 143 million miles last year and carried 535 million tons of cargo. Both accomplishments
far exceed those of any other American carrier. You can be proud of your railroad.
• BHE, our final Giant, earned a record $4 billion in 2021. That’s up more than 30-fold from the $122 million
earned in 2000, the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake. Now, Berkshire owns 91.1% of thecompany.
BHE’s record of societal accomplishment is as remarkable as its financial performance. The company had
nowind or solar generation in 2000. It was then regarded simply as a relatively new and minor participant in
the huge electric utility industry. Subsequently, under David Sokol’s and Greg Abel’s leadership, BHE hasbecome a utility powerhouse (no groaning, please) and a leading force in wind, solar and transmissionthroughout much of the United States.
Greg’s report on these accomplishments appears on pages A-3 and A-4. The profile you will find there is not
in any way one of those currently-fashionable “green-washing” stories. BHE has been faithfully detailing itsplans and performance in renewables and transmissions every year since 2007 .
To further review this information, visit BHE’s website at brkenergy.com. There, you will see that the
company has long been making climate-conscious moves that soak up allof its earnings. More opportunities
lie ahead. BHE has the management, the experience, the capital and the appetite for the huge power projectsthat our country needs.
6Investments
Now let’s talk about companies we don’t control, a list that again references Apple. Below we list our fifteen
largest equity holdings, several of which are selections of Berkshire’s two long-time investment managers, ToddCombs and Ted Weschler. At yearend, this valued pair had total authority in respect to $34 billion of investments,
many of which do not meet the threshold value we use in the table. Also, a significant portion of the dollars that Toddand Ted manage are lodged in various pension plans of Berkshire-owned businesses, with the assets of these plans not
included in this table.

marketable arena.
3Surprise, Surprise
Here are a few items about your company that often surprise even seasoned investors:
• Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth,
Berkshire owns and operates more U.S.-based “infrastructure” assets – classified on our balance sheet as
property, plant and equipment – than are owned and operated by any other American corporation. That
supremacy has never been our goal. It has, however, become a fact.
At yearend, those domestic infrastructure assets were carried on Berkshire’s balance sheet at $158 billion.
That number increased last year and will continue to increase. Berkshire always will be building.
• Every year, your company makes substantial federal income tax payments. In 2021, for example, we paid
$3.3 billion while the U.S. Treasury reported total corporate income-tax receipts of $402 billion.
Additionally, Berkshire pays substantial state and foreign taxes. “I gave at the office” is an unassailableassertion when made by Berkshire shareholders.
Berkshire’s history vividly illustrates the invisible and often unrecognized financial partnership between
government and American businesses. Our tale begins early in 1955, when Berkshire Fine Spinning andHathaway Manufacturing agreed to merge their businesses. In their requests for shareholder approval, thesevenerable New England textile companies expressed high hopes for the combination.
The Hathaway solicitation, for example, assured its shareholders that “The combination of the resources and
managements will result in one of the strongest and most efficient organizations in the textile industry.” Thatupbeat view was endorsed by the company’s advisor, Lehman Brothers (yes, that Lehman Brothers).
I’m sure it was a joyous day in both Fall River (Berkshire) and New Bedford (Hathaway) when the union
was consummated. After the bands stopped playing and the bankers went home, however, the shareholdersreaped a disaster.
In the nine years following the merger, Berkshire’s owners watched the company’s net worth crater from
$51.4 million to $22.1 million. In part, this decline was caused by stock repurchases, ill-advised dividendsand plant shutdowns. But nine years of effort by many thousands of employees delivered an operating lossas well. Berkshire’s struggles were not unusual: The New England textile industry had silently entered anextended and non-reversible death march.
During the nine post-merger years, the U.S. Treasury suffered as well from Berkshire’s troubles. All told, the
company paid the government only $337,359 in income tax during that period – a pathetic $100 per day .
Early in 1965, things changed. Berkshire installed new management that redeployed available cash and
steered essentially allearnings into a variety of good businesses, most of which remained good through the
years. Coupling reinvestment of earnings with the power of compounding worked its magic, and shareholdersprospered.
Berkshire’s owners, it should be noted, were not the only beneficiary of that course correction. Their “silent
partner,” the U.S. Treasury, proceeded to collect many tens of billions of dollars from the company in income
tax payments. Remember the $100 daily? Now, Berkshire pays roughly $9 million daily to the Treasury.
4In fairness to our governmental partner, our shareholders should acknowledge – indeed trumpet – the fact
that Berkshire’s prosperity has been fostered mightily because the company has operated in America. Our
country would have done splendidly in the years since 1965 without Berkshire. Absent our American home,
however, Berkshire would never have come close to becoming what it is today. When you see the flag, saythanks.
• From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader in
insurance “float” – money we hold and can invest but that does not belong to us. Including a relatively small
sum derived from life insurance, Berkshire’s total float has grown from $19 million when we entered the
insurance business to $147 billion .
So far, this float has cost us less than nothing. Though we have experienced a number of years when insurance
losses combined with operating expenses exceeded premiums, overall we have earned a modest 55-year
profit from the underwriting activities that generated our float.
Of equal importance, float is very sticky. Funds attributable to our insurance operations come and go daily,
but their aggregate total is immune from precipitous decline. When it comes to investing float, we cantherefore think long-term.
If you are not already familiar with the concept of float, I refer you to a long explanation on page A-5. To
my surprise, our float increased $9 billion last year, a buildup of value that is important to Berkshire ownersthough is not reflected in our GAAP (“generally-accepted accounting principles”) presentation of earnings
and net worth.
Much of our huge value creation in insurance is attributable to Berkshire’s good luck in my 1986 hiring of
Ajit Jain. We first met on a Saturday morning, and I quickly asked Ajit what his insurance experience hadbeen. He replied, “None.”
I said, “Nobody’s perfect,” and hired him. That was my lucky day: Ajit actually was as perfect a choice as
could have been made. Better yet, he continues to be – 35 years later.
One final thought about insurance: I believe that it is likely – but farfrom assured – that Berkshire’s float
can be maintained without our incurring a long-term underwriting loss. I am certain , however, that there will
be some years when we experience such losses, perhaps involving very large sums.
Berkshire is constructed to handle catastrophic events as no other insurer – and that priority will remain long
after Charlie and I are gone.
Our Four Giants
Through Berkshire, our shareholders own many dozens of businesses. Some of these, in turn, have a
collection of subsidiaries of their own. For example, Marmon has more than 100 individual business operations,ranging from the leasing of railroad cars to the manufacture of medical devices.
• Nevertheless, operations of our “Big Four” companies account for a very large chunk of Berkshire’s value.
Leading this list is our cluster of insurers. Berkshire effectively owns 100% of this group, whose massivefloat value we earlier described. The invested assets of these insurers are further enlarged by the extraordinaryamount of capital we invest to back up their promises.
5The insurance business is made to order for Berkshire. The product will never be obsolete, and sales volume
will generally increase along with both economic growth and inflation. Also, integrity and capital will foreverbe important. Our company can and will behave well.
There are, of course, other insurers with excellent business models and prospects. Replication of Berkshire’s
operation, however, would be almost impossible.
• Apple – our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value – is a different sort of holding. Here,
our ownership is a mere 5.55%, up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. Butconsider that each 0.1% of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million . We spent noBerkshire funds
to gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job.
It’s important to understand that only dividends from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire
reports – and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amountedto a staggering $5.6 billion . Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an act
we applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his firstlove, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well.
• BNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it an
indispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries wereinstead hauled by truck, America’s carbon emissions would soar.
Your railroad had record earnings of $6 billion in 2021. Here, it should be noted, we are talking about the
old-fashioned sort of earnings that we favor: a figure calculated after interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization and all forms of compensation. (Our definition suggests a warning: Deceptive “adjustments” toearnings – to use a polite description – have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks haverisen. Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull . . ..)
BNSF trains traveled 143 million miles last year and carried 535 million tons of cargo. Both accomplishments
far exceed those of any other American carrier. You can be proud of your railroad.
• BHE, our final Giant, earned a record $4 billion in 2021. That’s up more than 30-fold from the $122 million
earned in 2000, the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake. Now, Berkshire owns 91.1% of thecompany.
BHE’s record of societal accomplishment is as remarkable as its financial performance. The company had
nowind or solar generation in 2000. It was then regarded simply as a relatively new and minor participant in
the huge electric utility industry. Subsequently, under David Sokol’s and Greg Abel’s leadership, BHE hasbecome a utility powerhouse (no groaning, please) and a leading force in wind, solar and transmissionthroughout much of the United States.
Greg’s report on these accomplishments appears on pages A-3 and A-4. The profile you will find there is not
in any way one of those currently-fashionable “green-washing” stories. BHE has been faithfully detailing itsplans and performance in renewables and transmissions every year since 2007 .
To further review this information, visit BHE’s website at brkenergy.com. There, you will see that the
company has long been making climate-conscious moves that soak up allof its earnings. More opportunities
lie ahead. BHE has the management, the experience, the capital and the appetite for the huge power projectsthat our country needs.
6Investments
Now let’s talk about companies we don’t control, a list that again references Apple. Below we list our fifteen
largest equity holdings, several of which are selections of Berkshire’s two long-time investment managers, ToddCombs and Ted Weschler. At yearend, this valued pair had total authority in respect to $34 billion of investments,
many of which do not meet the threshold value we use in the table. Also, a significant portion of the dollars that Toddand Ted manage are lodged in various pension plans of Berkshire-owned businesses, with the assets of these plans not
included in this table.

2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.
To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:
Charlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I have the job of managing a portion of your savings. We are
honored by your trust.
Our position carries with it the responsibility to report to you what we would like to know if wewere the
absentee owner and you were the manager. We enjoy communicating directly with you through this annual letter, and
through the annual meeting as well.
Our policy is to treat all shareholders equally. Therefore, we do not hold discussions with analysts nor large
institutions. Whenever possible, also, we release important communications on Saturday mornings in order tomaximize the time for shareholders and the media to absorb the news before markets open on Monday.
A wealth of Berkshire facts and figures are set forth in the annual 10-K that the company regularly files with
the S.E.C. and that we reproduce on pages K-1 – K-119. Some shareholders will find this detail engrossing; otherswill simply prefer to learn what Charlie and I believe is new or interesting at Berkshire.
Alas, there was little action of that sort in 2021. We did, though, make reasonable progress in increasing the
intrinsic value of your shares. That task has been my primary duty for 57 years. And it will continue to be.
What You Own
Berkshire owns a wide variety of businesses, some in their entirety, some only in part. The second group
largely consists of marketable common stocks of major American companies. Additionally, we own a few non-U.S.equities and participate in several joint ventures or other collaborative activities.
Whatever our form of ownership, our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesses with both durable
economic advantages and a first-class CEO. Please note particularly that we own stocks based upon our expectationsabout their long-term business performance and notbecause we view them as vehicles for timely market moves. That
point is crucial: Charlie and I are notstock-pickers; we are business-pickers.
I make many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses includes some enterprises that
have truly extraordinary economics, many others that enjoy good economic characteristics, and a few that aremarginal. One advantage of our common-stock segment is that – on occasion – it becomes easy to buy pieces of
wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. That shooting-fish-in-a-barrel experience is very rare in negotiated
transactions and never occurs en masse . It is also far easier to exit from a mistake when it has been made in the
marketable arena.
3Surprise, Surprise
Here are a few items about your company that often surprise even seasoned investors:

Now let’s talk about companies we don’t control, a list that again references Apple. Below we list our fifteen
largest equity holdings, several of which are selections of Berkshire’s two long-time investment managers, ToddCombs and Ted Weschler. At yearend, this valued pair had total authority in respect to $34 billion of investments,
many of which do not meet the threshold value we use in the table. Also, a significant portion of the dollars that Toddand Ted manage are lodged in various pension plans of Berkshire-owned businesses, with the assets of these plans not

1BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.
To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:
Charlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I have the job of managing a portion of your savings. We are
honored by your trust.
Our position carries with it the responsibility to report to you what we would like to know if wewere the
absentee owner and you were the manager. We enjoy communicating directly with you through this annual letter, and
through the annual meeting as well.
Our policy is to treat all shareholders equally. Therefore, we do not hold discussions with analysts nor large
institutions. Whenever possible, also, we release important communications on Saturday mornings in order tomaximize the time for shareholders and the media to absorb the news before markets open on Monday.
A wealth of Berkshire facts and figures are set forth in the annual 10-K that the company regularly files with
the S.E.C. and that we reproduce on pages K-1 – K-119. Some shareholders will find this detail engrossing; otherswill simply prefer to learn what Charlie and I believe is new or interesting at Berkshire.
Alas, there was little action of that sort in 2021. We did, though, make reasonable progress in increasing the
intrinsic value of your shares. That task has been my primary duty for 57 years. And it will continue to be.
What You Own
Berkshire owns a wide variety of businesses, some in their entirety, some only in part. The second group
largely consists of marketable common stocks of major American companies. Additionally, we own a few non-U.S.equities and participate in several joint ventures or other collaborative activities.
Whatever our form of ownership, our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesses with both durable
economic advantages and a first-class CEO. Please note particularly that we own stocks based upon our expectationsabout their long-term business performance and notbecause we view them as vehicles for timely market moves. That
point is crucial: Charlie and I are notstock-pickers; we are business-pickers.
I make many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses includes some enterprises that
have truly extraordinary economics, many others that enjoy good economic characteristics, and a few that aremarginal. One advantage of our common-stock segment is that – on occasion – it becomes easy to buy pieces of
wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. That shooting-fish-in-a-barrel experience is very rare in negotiated
transactions and never occurs en masse . It is also far easier to exit from a mistake when it has been made in the
marketable arena.
3Surprise, Surprise
Here are a few items about your company that often surprise even seasoned investors:
• Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth,
Berkshire owns and operates more U.S.-based “infrastructure” assets – classified on our balance sheet as
property, plant and equipment – than are owned and operated by any other American corporation. That
supremacy has never been our goal. It has, however, become a fact.
At yearend, those domestic infrastructure assets were carried on Berkshire’s balance sheet at $158 billion.
That number increased last year and will continue to increase. Berkshire always will be building.
• Every year, your company makes substantial federal income tax payments. In 2021, for example, we paid
$3.3 billion while the U.S. Treasury reported total corporate income-tax receipts of $402 billion.
Additionally, Berkshire pays substantial state and foreign taxes. “I gave at the office” is an unassailableassertion when made by Berkshire shareholders.
Berkshire’s history vividly illustrates the invisible and often unrecognized financial partnership between
government and American businesses. Our tale begins early in 1955, when Berkshire Fine Spinning andHathaway Manufacturing agreed to merge their businesses. In their requests for shareholder approval, thesevenerable New England textile companies expressed high hopes for the combination.
The Hathaway solicitation, for example, assured its shareholders that “The combination of the resources and
managements will result in one of the strongest and most efficient organizations in the textile industry.” Thatupbeat view was endorsed by the company’s advisor, Lehman Brothers (yes, that Lehman Brothers).
I’m sure it was a joyous day in both Fall River (Berkshire) and New Bedford (Hathaway) when the union
was consummated. After the bands stopped playing and the bankers went home, however, the shareholdersreaped a disaster.
In the nine years following the merger, Berkshire’s owners watched the company’s net worth crater from
$51.4 million to $22.1 million. In part, this decline was caused by stock repurchases, ill-advised dividendsand plant shutdowns. But nine years of effort by many thousands of employees delivered an operating lossas well. Berkshire’s struggles were not unusual: The New England textile industry had silently entered anextended and non-reversible death march.
During the nine post-merger years, the U.S. Treasury suffered as well from Berkshire’s troubles. All told, the
company paid the government only $337,359 in income tax during that period – a pathetic $100 per day .
Early in 1965, things changed. Berkshire installed new management that redeployed available cash and
steered essentially allearnings into a variety of good businesses, most of which remained good through the
years. Coupling reinvestment of earnings with the power of compounding worked its magic, and shareholdersprospered.
Berkshire’s owners, it should be noted, were not the only beneficiary of that course correction. Their “silent
partner,” the U.S. Treasury, proceeded to collect many tens of billions of dollars from the company in income
tax payments. Remember the $100 daily? Now, Berkshire pays roughly $9 million daily to the Treasury.
4In fairness to our governmental partner, our shareholders should acknowledge – indeed trumpet – the fact
that Berkshire’s prosperity has been fostered mightily because the company has operated in America. Our
country would have done splendidly in the years since 1965 without Berkshire. Absent our American home,
however, Berkshire would never have come close to becoming what it is today. When you see the flag, saythanks.
• From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader in
insurance “float” – money we hold and can invest but that does not belong to us. Including a relatively small
sum derived from life insurance, Berkshire’s total float has grown from $19 million when we entered the
insurance business to $147 billion .
So far, this float has cost us less than nothing. Though we have experienced a number of years when insurance
losses combined with operating expenses exceeded premiums, overall we have earned a modest 55-year
profit from the underwriting activities that generated our float.
Of equal importance, float is very sticky. Funds attributable to our insurance operations come and go daily,
but their aggregate total is immune from precipitous decline. When it comes to investing float, we cantherefore think long-term.
If you are not already familiar with the concept of float, I refer you to a long explanation on page A-5. To
my surprise, our float increased $9 billion last year, a buildup of value that is important to Berkshire ownersthough is not reflected in our GAAP (“generally-accepted accounting principles”) presentation of earnings
and net worth.
Much of our huge value creation in insurance is attributable to Berkshire’s good luck in my 1986 hiring of
Ajit Jain. We first met on a Saturday morning, and I quickly asked Ajit what his insurance experience hadbeen. He replied, “None.”
I said, “Nobody’s perfect,” and hired him. That was my lucky day: Ajit actually was as perfect a choice as
could have been made. Better yet, he continues to be – 35 years later.
One final thought about insurance: I believe that it is likely – but farfrom assured – that Berkshire’s float
can be maintained without our incurring a long-term underwriting loss. I am certain , however, that there will
be some years when we experience such losses, perhaps involving very large sums.
Berkshire is constructed to handle catastrophic events as no other insurer – and that priority will remain long
after Charlie and I are gone.
Our Four Giants
Through Berkshire, our shareholders own many dozens of businesses. Some of these, in turn, have a
collection of subsidiaries of their own. For example, Marmon has more than 100 individual business operations,ranging from the leasing of railroad cars to the manufacture of medical devices.
• Nevertheless, operations of our “Big Four” companies account for a very large chunk of Berkshire’s value.
Leading this list is our cluster of insurers. Berkshire effectively owns 100% of this group, whose massivefloat value we earlier described. The invested assets of these insurers are further enlarged by the extraordinaryamount of capital we invest to back up their promises.
5The insurance business is made to order for Berkshire. The product will never be obsolete, and sales volume
will generally increase along with both economic growth and inflation. Also, integrity and capital will foreverbe important. Our company can and will behave well.
There are, of course, other insurers with excellent business models and prospects. Replication of Berkshire’s
operation, however, would be almost impossible.
• Apple – our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value – is a different sort of holding. Here,
our ownership is a mere 5.55%, up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. Butconsider that each 0.1% of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million . We spent noBerkshire funds
to gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job.
It’s important to understand that only dividends from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire
reports – and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amountedto a staggering $5.6 billion . Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an act
we applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his firstlove, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well.
• BNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it an
indispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries wereinstead hauled by truck, America’s carbon emissions would soar.
Your railroad had record earnings of $6 billion in 2021. Here, it should be noted, we are talking about the
old-fashioned sort of earnings that we favor: a figure calculated after interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization and all forms of compensation. (Our definition suggests a warning: Deceptive “adjustments” toearnings – to use a polite description – have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks haverisen. Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull . . ..)
BNSF trains traveled 143 million miles last year and carried 535 million tons of cargo. Both accomplishments
far exceed those of any other American carrier. You can be proud of your railroad.
• BHE, our final Giant, earned a record $4 billion in 2021. That’s up more than 30-fold from the $122 million
earned in 2000, the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake. Now, Berkshire owns 91.1% of thecompany.
BHE’s record of societal accomplishment is as remarkable as its financial performance. The company had
nowind or solar generation in 2000. It was then regarded simply as a relatively new and minor participant in
the huge electric utility industry. Subsequently, under David Sokol’s and Greg Abel’s leadership, BHE hasbecome a utility powerhouse (no groaning, please) and a leading force in wind, solar and transmissionthroughout much of the United States.
Greg’s report on these accomplishments appears on pages A-3 and A-4. The profile you will find there is not
in any way one of those currently-fashionable “green-washing” stories. BHE has been faithfully detailing itsplans and performance in renewables and transmissions every year since 2007 .
To further review this information, visit BHE’s website at brkenergy.com. There, you will see that the
company has long been making climate-conscious moves that soak up allof its earnings. More opportunities
lie ahead. BHE has the management, the experience, the capital and the appetite for the huge power projectsthat our country needs.

1BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.
To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:
Charlie Munger, my long-time partner, and I have the job of managing a portion of your savings. We are
honored by your trust.
Our position carries with it the responsibility to report to you what we would like to know if wewere the
absentee owner and you were the manager. We enjoy communicating directly with you through this annual letter, and
through the annual meeting as well.
Our policy is to treat all shareholders equally. Therefore, we do not hold discussions with analysts nor large
institutions. Whenever possible, also, we release important communications on Saturday mornings in order tomaximize the time for shareholders and the media to absorb the news before markets open on Monday.
A wealth of Berkshire facts and figures are set forth in the annual 10-K that the company regularly files with
the S.E.C. and that we reproduce on pages K-1 – K-119. Some shareholders will find this detail engrossing; otherswill simply prefer to learn what Charlie and I believe is new or interesting at Berkshire.
Alas, there was little action of that sort in 2021. We did, though, make reasonable progress in increasing the
intrinsic value of your shares. That task has been my primary duty for 57 years. And it will continue to be.
What You Own
Berkshire owns a wide variety of businesses, some in their entirety, some only in part. The second group
largely consists of marketable common stocks of major American companies. Additionally, we own a few non-U.S.equities and participate in several joint ventures or other collaborative activities.
Whatever our form of ownership, our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesses with both durable
economic advantages and a first-class CEO. Please note particularly that we own stocks based upon our expectationsabout their long-term business performance and notbecause we view them as vehicles for timely market moves. That
point is crucial: Charlie and I are notstock-pickers; we are business-pickers.
I make many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses includes some enterprises that
have truly extraordinary economics, many others that enjoy good economic characteristics, and a few that aremarginal. One advantage of our common-stock segment is that – on occasion – it becomes easy to buy pieces of
wonderful businesses at wonderful prices. That shooting-fish-in-a-barrel experience is very rare in negotiated
transactions and never occurs en masse . It is also far easier to exit from a mistake when it has been made in the
marketable arena.
3Surprise, Surprise
Here are a few items about your company that often surprise even seasoned investors:
• Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth,
Berkshire owns and operates more U.S.-based “infrastructure” assets – classified on our balance sheet as
property, plant and equipment – than are owned and operated by any other American corporation. That
supremacy has never been our goal. It has, however, become a fact.
At yearend, those domestic infrastructure assets were carried on Berkshire’s balance sheet at $158 billion.
That number increased last year and will continue to increase. Berkshire always will be building.
• Every year, your company makes substantial federal income tax payments. In 2021, for example, we paid
$3.3 billion while the U.S. Treasury reported total corporate income-tax receipts of $402 billion.
Additionally, Berkshire pays substantial state and foreign taxes. “I gave at the office” is an unassailableassertion when made by Berkshire shareholders.
Berkshire’s history vividly illustrates the invisible and often unrecognized financial partnership between
government and American businesses. Our tale begins early in 1955, when Berkshire Fine Spinning andHathaway Manufacturing agreed to merge their businesses. In their requests for shareholder approval, thesevenerable New England textile companies expressed high hopes for the combination.
The Hathaway solicitation, for example, assured its shareholders that “The combination of the resources and
managements will result in one of the strongest and most efficient organizations in the textile industry.” Thatupbeat view was endorsed by the company’s advisor, Lehman Brothers (yes, that Lehman Brothers).
I’m sure it was a joyous day in both Fall River (Berkshire) and New Bedford (Hathaway) when the union
was consummated. After the bands stopped playing and the bankers went home, however, the shareholdersreaped a disaster.
In the nine years following the merger, Berkshire’s owners watched the company’s net worth crater from
$51.4 million to $22.1 million. In part, this decline was caused by stock repurchases, ill-advised dividendsand plant shutdowns. But nine years of effort by many thousands of employees delivered an operating lossas well. Berkshire’s struggles were not unusual: The New England textile industry had silently entered anextended and non-reversible death march.
During the nine post-merger years, the U.S. Treasury suffered as well from Berkshire’s troubles. All told, the
company paid the government only $337,359 in income tax during that period – a pathetic $100 per day .
Early in 1965, things changed. Berkshire installed new management that redeployed available cash and
steered essentially allearnings into a variety of good businesses, most of which remained good through the
years. Coupling reinvestment of earnings with the power of compounding worked its magic, and shareholdersprospered.
Berkshire’s owners, it should be noted, were not the only beneficiary of that course correction. Their “silent
partner,” the U.S. Treasury, proceeded to collect many tens of billions of dollars from the company in income
tax payments. Remember the $100 daily? Now, Berkshire pays roughly $9 million daily to the Treasury.
4In fairness to our governmental partner, our shareholders should acknowledge – indeed trumpet – the fact
that Berkshire’s prosperity has been fostered mightily because the company has operated in America. Our
country would have done splendidly in the years since 1965 without Berkshire. Absent our American home,
however, Berkshire would never have come close to becoming what it is today. When you see the flag, saythanks.
• From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader in
insurance “float” – money we hold and can invest but that does not belong to us. Including a relatively small
sum derived from life insurance, Berkshire’s total float has grown from $19 million when we entered the
insurance business to $147 billion .
So far, this float has cost us less than nothing. Though we have experienced a number of years when insurance
losses combined with operating expenses exceeded premiums, overall we have earned a modest 55-year
profit from the underwriting activities that generated our float.
Of equal importance, float is very sticky. Funds attributable to our insurance operations come and go daily,
but their aggregate total is immune from precipitous decline. When it comes to investing float, we cantherefore think long-term.
If you are not already familiar with the concept of float, I refer you to a long explanation on page A-5. To
my surprise, our float increased $9 billion last year, a buildup of value that is important to Berkshire ownersthough is not reflected in our GAAP (“generally-accepted accounting principles”) presentation of earnings
and net worth.
Much of our huge value creation in insurance is attributable to Berkshire’s good luck in my 1986 hiring of
Ajit Jain. We first met on a Saturday morning, and I quickly asked Ajit what his insurance experience hadbeen. He replied, “None.”
I said, “Nobody’s perfect,” and hired him. That was my lucky day: Ajit actually was as perfect a choice as
could have been made. Better yet, he continues to be – 35 years later.
One final thought about insurance: I believe that it is likely – but farfrom assured – that Berkshire’s float
can be maintained without our incurring a long-term underwriting loss. I am certain , however, that there will
be some years when we experience such losses, perhaps involving very large sums.
Berkshire is constructed to handle catastrophic events as no other insurer – and that priority will remain long
after Charlie and I are gone.
Our Four Giants
Through Berkshire, our shareholders own many dozens of businesses. Some of these, in turn, have a
collection of subsidiaries of their own. For example, Marmon has more than 100 individual business operations,ranging from the leasing of railroad cars to the manufacture of medical devices.
• Nevertheless, operations of our “Big Four” companies account for a very large chunk of Berkshire’s value.
Leading this list is our cluster of insurers. Berkshire effectively owns 100% of this group, whose massivefloat value we earlier described. The invested assets of these insurers are further enlarged by the extraordinaryamount of capital we invest to back up their promises.
5The insurance business is made to order for Berkshire. The product will never be obsolete, and sales volume
will generally increase along with both economic growth and inflation. Also, integrity and capital will foreverbe important. Our company can and will behave well.
There are, of course, other insurers with excellent business models and prospects. Replication of Berkshire’s
operation, however, would be almost impossible.
• Apple – our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value – is a different sort of holding. Here,
our ownership is a mere 5.55%, up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. Butconsider that each 0.1% of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million . We spent noBerkshire funds
to gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job.
It’s important to understand that only dividends from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire
reports – and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amountedto a staggering $5.6 billion . Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an act
we applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his firstlove, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well.
• BNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it an
indispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries wereinstead hauled by truck, America’s carbon emissions would soar.
Your railroad had record earnings of $6 billion in 2021. Here, it should be noted, we are talking about the
old-fashioned sort of earnings that we favor: a figure calculated after interest, taxes, depreciation,
amortization and all forms of compensation. (Our definition suggests a warning: Deceptive “adjustments” toearnings – to use a polite description – have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks haverisen. Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull . . ..)
BNSF trains traveled 143 million miles last year and carried 535 million tons of cargo. Both accomplishments
far exceed those of any other American carrier. You can be proud of your railroad.
• BHE, our final Giant, earned a record $4 billion in 2021. That’s up more than 30-fold from the $122 million
earned in 2000, the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake. Now, Berkshire owns 91.1% of thecompany.
BHE’s record of societal accomplishment is as remarkable as its financial performance. The company had
nowind or solar generation in 2000. It was then regarded simply as a relatively new and minor participant in
the huge electric utility industry. Subsequently, under David Sokol’s and Greg Abel’s leadership, BHE hasbecome a utility powerhouse (no groaning, please) and a leading force in wind, solar and transmissionthroughout much of the United States.
Greg’s report on these accomplishments appears on pages A-3 and A-4. The profile you will find there is not
in any way one of those currently-fashionable “green-washing” stories. BHE has been faithfully detailing itsplans and performance in renewables and transmissions every year since 2007 .
To further review this information, visit BHE’s website at brkenergy.com. There, you will see that the
company has long been making climate-conscious moves that soak up allof its earnings. More opportunities
lie ahead. BHE has the management, the experience, the capital and the appetite for the huge power projectsthat our country needs.
6Investments
Now let’s talk about companies we don’t control, a list that again references Apple. Below we list our fifteen
largest equity holdings, several of which are selections of Berkshire’s two long-time investment managers, ToddCombs and Ted Weschler. At yearend, this valued pair had total authority in respect to $34 billion of investments,
many of which do not meet the threshold value we use in the table. Also, a significant portion of the dollars that Toddand Ted manage are lodged in various pension plans of Berkshire-owned businesses, with the assets of these plans not
included in this table.

7U.S. Treasury Bills
Berkshire’s balance sheet includes $144 billion of cash and cash equivalents (excluding the holdings of
BNSF and BHE). Of this sum, $120 billion is held in U.S. Treasury bills, all maturing in less than a year. That stakeleaves Berkshire financing about
12of 1% of the publicly-held national debt.
Charlie and I have pledged that Berkshire (along with our subsidiaries other than BNSF and BHE) will always
hold more than $30 billion of cash and equivalents. We want your company to be financially impregnable and never
dependent on the kindness of strangers (or even that of friends). Both of us like to sleep soundly, and we want ourcreditors, insurance claimants and you to do so as well.
But $144 billion?That imposing sum, I assure you, is not some deranged expression of patriotism. Nor have Charlie and I lost
our overwhelming preference for business ownership. Indeed, I first manifested my enthusiasm for that 80 years ago,
on March 11, 1942, when I purchased three shares of Cities Services preferred stock. Their cost was $114.75 andrequired allof my savings. (The Dow Jones Industrial Average that day closed at 99, a fact that should scream to you:
Never bet against America.)
After my initial plunge, I always kept at least 80% of my net worth in equities. My favored status throughout
that period was 100% – and still is. Berkshire’s current 80%-or-so position in businesses is a consequence of myfailure to find entire companies or small portions thereof (that is, marketable stocks) which meet our criteria for long-term holding.
Charlie and I have endured similar cash-heavy positions from time to time in the past. These periods are
never pleasant; they are also never permanent. And, fortunately, we have had a mildly attractive alternative during2020 and 2021 for deploying capital. Read on.
Share Repurchases
There are three ways that we can increase the value of your investment. The first is always front and center
in our minds: Increase the long-term earning power of Berkshire’s controlled businesses through internal growth orby making acquisitions. Today, internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions. The size of thoseopportunities, however, is small compared to Berkshire’s resources.
Our second choice is to buy non-controlling part-interests in the many good or great businesses that are
publicly traded. From time to time, such possibilities are both numerous and blatantly attractive. Today, though, wefind little that excites us.
That’s largely because of a truism: Long-term interest rates that are low push the prices of allproductive
investments upward, whether these are stocks, apartments, farms, oil wells, whatever. Other factors influencevaluations as well, but interest rates will always be important.
Our final path to value creation is to repurchase Berkshire shares. Through that simple act, we increase your
share of the many controlled and non-controlled businesses Berkshire owns. When the price/value equation is right,
this path is the easiest and most certain way for us to increase your wealth. (Alongside the accretion of value tocontinuing shareholders, a couple of other parties gain: Repurchases are modestly beneficial to the seller of therepurchased shares and to society as well.)
8Periodically, as alternative paths become unattractive, repurchases make good sense for Berkshire’s owners.
During the past two years, we therefore repurchased 9% of the shares that were outstanding at yearend 2019 for a total
cost of $51.7 billion. That expenditure left our continuing shareholders owning about 10% more of allBerkshire
businesses, whether these are wholly-owned (such as BNSF and GEICO) or partly-owned (such as Coca-Cola andMoody’s).
I want to underscore that for Berkshire repurchases to make sense, our shares must offer appropriate value.
We don’t want to overpay for the shares of other companies, and it would be value -destroying if we were to overpay
when we are buying Berkshire. As of February 23, 2022, since yearend we repurchased additional shares at a cost of$1.2 billion. Our appetite remains large but will always remain price-dependent.
It should be noted that Berkshire’s buyback opportunities are limited because of its high-class investor base.
If our shares were heavily held by short-term speculators, both price volatility and transaction volumes wouldmaterially increase. That kind of reshaping would offer us far greater opportunities for creating value by makingrepurchases. Nevertheless, Charlie and I far prefer the owners we have, even though their admirable buy-and-keepattitudes limit the extent to which long-term shareholders can profit from opportunistic repurchases.
Finally, one easily-overlooked value calculation specific to Berkshire: As we’ve discussed, insurance “float”
of the right sort is of great value to us. As it happens, repurchases automatically increase the amount of “float” per
share . That figure has increased during the past two years by 25% – going from $79,387 per “A” share to $99,497, a
meaningful gain that, as noted, owes some thanks to repurchases.
A Wonderful Man and a Wonderful Business
Last year, Paul Andrews died. Paul was the founder and CEO of TTI, a Fort Worth-based subsidiary of
Berkshire. Throughout his life – in both his business and his personal pursuits – Paul quietly displayed all the qualities
that Charlie and I admire. His story should be told.
In 1971, Paul was working as a purchasing agent for General Dynamics when the roof fell in. After losing a
huge defense contract, the company fired thousands of employees, including Paul.
With his first child due soon, Paul decided to bet on himself, using $500 of his savings to found Tex-Tronics
(later renamed TTI). The company set itself up to distribute small electronic components, and first-year sales totaled$112,000. Today, TTI markets more than one million different items with annual volume of $7.7 billion.
But back to 2006: Paul, at 63, then found himself happy with his family, his job, and his associates. But he
had one nagging worry, heightened because he had recently witnessed a friend’s early death and the disastrous resultsthat followed for that man’s family and business. What, Paul asked himself in 2006, would happen to the many peopledepending on him if he should unexpectedly die?
For a year, Paul wrestled with his options. Sell to a competitor? From a strictly economic viewpoint, that
course made the most sense. After all, competitors could envision lucrative “synergies” – savings that would beachieved as the acquiror slashed duplicated functions at TTI.
B u t...S u c hap u r c h aser would most certainly also retain itsCFO, itslegal counsel, itsHR unit. Their TTI
counterparts would therefore be sent packing. And ugh! If a new distribution center were to be needed, the acquirer’shome city would certainly be favored over Fort Worth.
9Whatever the financial benefits, Paul quickly concluded that selling to a competitor was not for him. He next
considered seeking a financial buyer, a species once labeled – aptly so – a leveraged buyout firm. Paul knew, however,that such a purchaser would be focused on an “exit strategy.” And who could know what that would be? Broodingover it all, Paul found himself having no interest in handing his 35-year-old creation over to a reseller.
When Paul met me, he explained why he had eliminated these two alternatives as buyers. He then summed
up his dilemma by saying – in far more tactful phrasing than this – “After a year of pondering the alternatives, I wantto sell to Berkshire because you are the only guy left.” So, I made an offer and Paul said “Yes.” One meeting; onelunch; one deal.
To say we both lived happily ever after is an understatement. When Berkshire purchased TTI, the company
employed 2,387. Now the number is 8,043. A large percentage of that growth took place in Fort Worth and environs.Earnings have increased 673%.
Annually, I would call Paul and tell him his salary should be substantially increased. Annually, he would tell
me, “We can talk about that next year, Warren; I’m too busy now.”
When Greg Abel and I attended Paul’s memorial service, we met children, grandchildren, long-time
associates (including TTI’s first employee) and John Roach, the former CEO of a Fort Worth company Berkshire hadpurchased in 2000. John had steered his friend Paul to Omaha, instinctively knowing we would be a match.
At the service, Greg and I heard about the multitudes of people and organizations that Paul had silently
supported. The breadth of his generosity was extraordinary – geared always to improving the lives of others,particularly those in Fort Worth.
In all ways, Paul was a class act.
************
Good luck – occasionally extraordinary luck – has played its part at Berkshire. If Paul and I had not enjoyed
a mutual friend – John Roach – TTI would not have found its home with us. But that ample serving of luck was onlythe beginning. TTI was soon to lead Berkshire to its most important acquisition.
Every fall, Berkshire directors gather for a presentation by a few of our executives. We sometimes choose
the site based upon the location of a recent acquisition, by that means allowing directors to meet the new subsidiary’sCEO and learn more about the acquiree’s activities.
In the fall of 2009, we consequently selected Fort Worth so that we could visit TTI. At that time, BNSF,
which also had Fort Worth as its hometown, was the third-largest holding among our marketable equities. Despite thatlarge stake, I had never visited the railroad’s headquarters.
Deb Bosanek, my assistant, scheduled our board’s opening dinner for October 22. Meanwhile, I arranged to
arrive earlier that day to meet with Matt Rose, CEO of BNSF, whose accomplishments I had long admired. When Imade the date, I had no idea that our get-together would coincide with BNSF’s third-quarter earnings report, whichwas released late on the 22
nd.
The market reacted badly to the railroad’s results. The Great Recession was in full force in the third quarter,
and BNSF’s earnings reflected that slump. The economic outlook was also bleak, and Wall Street wasn’t feelingfriendly to railroads – or much else.
10On the following day, I again got together with Matt and suggested that Berkshire would offer the railroad a
better long-term home than it could expect as a public company. I also told him the maximum price that Berkshirewould pay.
Matt relayed the offer to his directors and advisors. Eleven busy days later, Berkshire and BNSF announced
a firm deal. And here I’ll venture a rare prediction: BNSF will be a key asset for Berkshire and our country a century
from now.
The BNSF acquisition would never have happened if Paul Andrews hadn’t sized up Berkshire as the right
home for TTI.
Thanks
I taught my first investing class 70 years ago. Since then, I have enjoyed working almost every year with
students of all ages, finally “retiring” from that pursuit in 2018.
Along the way, my toughest audience was my grandson’s fifth-grade class. The 11-year-olds were squirming
in their seats and giving me blank stares until I mentioned Coca-Cola and its famous secret formula. Instantly, everyhand went up, and I learned that “secrets” are catnip to kids.
Teaching, like writing, has helped me develop and clarify my own thoughts. Charlie calls this phenomenon
the orangutan effect: If you sit down with an orangutan and carefully explain to it one of your cherished ideas, youmay leave behind a puzzled primate, but will yourself exit thinking more clearly.
Talking to university students is far superior. I have urged that they seek employment in (1) the field and (2)
with the kind of people they would select, if they had no need for money. Economic realities, I acknowledge, may
interfere with that kind of search. Even so, I urge the students never to give up the quest, for when they find that sortof job, they will no longer be “working.”
Charlie and I, ourselves, followed that liberating course after a few early stumbles. We both started as part-
timers at my grandfather’s grocery store, Charlie in 1940 and I in 1942. We were each assigned boring tasks and paidlittle, definitely not what we had in mind. Charlie later took up law, and I tried selling securities. Job satisfactioncontinued to elude us.
Finally, at Berkshire, we found what we love to do. With very few exceptions, we have now “worked” for
many decades with people whom we like and trust. It’s a joy in life to join with managers such as Paul Andrews orthe Berkshire families I told you about last year. In our home office, we employ decent and talented people – no jerks.Turnover averages, perhaps, one person per year.
Iw o u l dl i k e ,h o w e v e r ,t oe m p h a s i z eaf u r t h e ri t e mt h a tt u r n so u rj o b si n t of u na n ds a t i s f a c t i o n----w o r k i n g
for you. There is nothing more rewarding to Charlie and me than enjoying the trust of individual long-term
shareholders who, for many decades, have joined us with the expectation that we would be a reliable custodian of theirfunds.
Obviously, we can’t select our owners, as we could do if our form of operation were a partnership. Anyone
can buy shares of Berkshire today with the intention of soon reselling them. For sure, we get a few of that type ofshareholder, just as we get index funds that own huge amounts of Berkshire simply because they are required to doso.
11To a truly unusual degree, however, Berkshire has as owners a very large corps of individuals and families
that have elected to join us with an intent approaching “til death do us part.” Often, they have trusted us with a large– some might say excessive – portion of their savings.
Berkshire, these shareholders would sometimes acknowledge, might be far from the best selection they could
have made. But they would add that Berkshire would rank high among those with which they would be mostcomfortable. And people who are comfortable with their investments will, on average, achieve better results than thosewho are motivated by ever-changing headlines, chatter and promises.
Long-term individual owners are both the “partners” Charlie and I have always sought and the ones we
constantly have in mind as we make decisions at Berkshire. To them we say, “It feels good to ‘work’ for you, and youhave our thanks for your trust.”
The Annual Meeting
Clear your calendar! Berkshire will have its annual gathering of capitalists in Omaha on Friday, April 29th
through Sunday, May 1st. The details regarding the weekend are laid out on pages A-1 and A-2. Omaha eagerly awaits
you, as do I.
I will end this letter with a sales pitch. “Cousin” Jimmy Buffett has designed a pontoon “party” boat that is
now being manufactured by Forest River, a Berkshire subsidiary. The boat will be introduced on April 29 at ourBerkshire Bazaar of Bargains. And, for two days only, shareholders will be able to purchase Jimmy’s masterpiece ata 10% discount. Your bargain-hunting chairman will be buying a boat for his family’s use. Join me.

Item 1. Business Description
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire,” “Company” or “Registrant”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries
engaged in numerous diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both aprimary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation anddistribution businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates numerous other businesses engaged in a variety of manufacturing,services, retailing and other activities. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is inOmaha, Nebraska.
Berkshire’s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or
integrated business functions. Berkshire’s corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible forsignificant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the
operating businesses.
Berkshire’s senior management is also responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governance
practices, including monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in theresolution of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire’s Board of Directors is responsible for assuring an appropriatesuccessor to the Chief Executive Officer. The Berkshire Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes, among otherthings, the commitment to ethics and compliance with the law and provides basic standards for ethical and legal behavior ofits employees.
Human capital and resources are an integral and essential component of Berkshire’s businesses. Berkshire and its
consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 372,000 people worldwide at the end of 2021, of which approximately77% were in the United States and 21% were represented by unions. Employees engage in a wide variety of occupations.
Consistent with Berkshire’s decentralized management philosophy, Berkshire’s operating businesses individually establish
specific policies and practices concerning the attraction and retention of personnel within the organizations. Given the widevariations in the nature and size of business activities, policies and practices often vary widely among Berkshire’s operatingsubsidiaries. Policies and practices commonly address, among other things: maintaining a safe work environment andminimizing or eliminating workplace injuries; offering competitive compensation to employees, which includes varioushealth insurance and retirement benefits, as well as other benefits such as incentives to recognize and reward performance;wellness programs; training, learning and career advancement opportunities; and hiring practices intended to identifyqualified candidates and promote diversity and inclusion in the workforce.
Insurance and Reinsurance BusinessesBerkshire’s insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-based
insurance subsidiaries. Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risks
and reinsurance of life and health risks worldwide. Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries employed approximately 50,500 peopleat the end of 2021. For purposes of this discussion, entities that provide insurance or reinsurance are referred to as insurers.
In direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations that are
directly subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or otherperils that may arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the insurer assumes defined portions of risks that otherdirect insurers or reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities.
Reinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurance
coverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by a direct insurer or reinsurer, while facultativereinsurance involves coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-
share or excess. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the original
premiums and losses of the direct insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for theindemnification of the direct insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or“retention.” Both quota-share and excess reinsurancecontracts may provide for aggregatelimits of indemnification.
Insurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatory
considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may bedomestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurerscompete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service,business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms andcoverage conditions.K-2InsurersbasedintheUnitedStates(“U.S.”)aresubjecttoregulationbytheirstatesofdomicileandbythosestatesin
which they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers are
financially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels forinsurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority tosuspend or revoke a company’s authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends byinsurance companies to their shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions and othertransactions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior regulatory approval.
Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers are
referred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy formsand premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailable
throughadmitted insurers.Non-admitted insurance, o ftenreferredtoas“excessandsurplus”lines,isprocuredbyeitherstate-
licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured party’s direct
procurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect topolicy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurancecontracts.
The insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”).
The NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers in preparing and filing annualstatutory financial statements. However, an insurer’s state of domicile has ultimate authority over these matters. In addition toits activities relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws,regulations and programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management,
compliance with fina ncial regulation standards and ri sk-based capital reporting requirements.
U.S. states, through the NAIC, and international insurance regulators through the International Association of
Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) have been developing standards and best practices focused on establishing a common set ofprinciples (“Insurance Core Principles”) and framework (“ComFrame”) for the regulation of large multi-national insurancegroups. The IAIS is developing capital standards for internationally active insurance groups (the “Insurance CapitalStandard”) based on a consolidated group approach and is also evaluating a potentially comparable group capital standardbased on the aggregation of regulated entities and their underlying local capital requirements (the “Aggregation Method”).The IAIS standards address a variety of topics regarding supervision, coordination of regulators, insurance capital standards,risk management and governance. While the IAIS standards do not have legal effect, the states and the NAIC areimplementing various group supervision regulatory tools and mandates that are responsive to certain IAIS standards. U.S.state regulators have formed supervisory colleges intended to promote communication and cooperation amongst the various
domestic and international insurance regulators. The Nebraska Department of Insurance acts as the lead supervisor for our
group of insurance companies and chairs the Berkshire supervisory college. U.S. state regulators now require insurancegroups to file an annual report, the Own Risk Solvency Assessment or ORSA, with the group’s lead supervisor. The NAICrecently adopted a group capital calculation based on methodology similar to the Aggregation Method, which leverages theNAIC’s existing Risk Based Capital standards. The NAIC’s group capital calculation is a tool designed to help the leadsupervisor understand the capital adequacy across an insurance group. The NAIC is also developing further tools, includingvarious liquidityassessments, that willlikely beimposed on insurance groups in the near future.
Berkshire’s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which differentiates them from
their competitors. Collectively, the combined statutory surplus of Berkshire’s U.S.-based insurers was approximately $301billion at December31, 2021. Berkshire’s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s and A++
(superior) by A.M. Best with respectto their financialcondition and claimspaying ability.
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism Insurance
Program (“Program”) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of insured terrorismlosses. The Program currently extends to December31, 2027 through other Acts, most recently the Terrorism Risk InsuranceProgram Reauthorization Act of 2019. Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. Under TRIA, theDepartment of the Treasury is charged with certifying “acts of terrorism.” Coverage under TRIA occurs if the industryinsured loss for certifiedevents occurringduring the calendaryear exceeds $200 million in any calendaryear.
To be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, by
providing policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverageand of the federal share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is specifically
excluded from TRIA participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as personal and
commercial auto, burglary, theft, surety and certain professional liability lines). Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorismcoverageand are not eligiblefor federalreinsuranceof terrorism losses.K-3Intheeventofacertifiedactofterrorism, thefederalgovernment willreimburse insurers(conditione dontheir
satisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 80% of their insured losses in excess of an insurance group’sdeductible. Under the Program, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevantcommerciallines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in 2022 for Berkshire’s insurancegroup is expected to approximate $1.6 billion. There is also an aggregate program limit of $100 billion on the amount of thefederal government coverage for each TRIA year.
The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which our non-U.S. operations conduct
business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extentof the requirements differ substantially. For example:
•in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file monthly and/or quarterly financial reports, and
in others, only annual reports;
•some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas other
regulators permit direct sales contact between theinsurer and the customer;
•the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer’s use of localand offshore reinsurance vary;
•policy form filing and rate regulation vary by country;
•the frequency of contactand periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differ by country;
•the scope and prescriptive requirements of an insurer’s risk management and governance framework vary
significantly by country; and
•regulatory requirements relating to insurer dividend policies vary by country.
Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure and resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee
insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-basedapproach.
Berkshire’s insurance group operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of
subsidiaries. Berkshire insurance subsidiaries are located in several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom(“U.K.”), Ireland, Australia and South Africa, and also maintain branches in several other countries. Most of these foreignjurisdictions impose local capital requirements. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, localretention of funds and records, and data privacy and protection program requirements. Berkshire’s international insurance
companies are also subjectto multinational application of certain U.S. laws.
There are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Berkshire in multiple international jurisdictions and the
potential for significant effect on the Berkshire insurance group could be heightened as a result of recent industry andeconomic developments.
In 2016, the U.K. voted in a national referendum to withdraw from the European Union (“EU”) (“Brexit”), which
resulted in the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020. In anticipation of the U.K. leaving the EU, BerkshireHathaway European Insurance DAC in Ireland was established to permit property and casualty insurance and reinsurancebusinesses to continue to operate in the EU, and Berkshire continues to maintain a substantial presence in London followingBrexit.
Berkshire’s insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1) GEICO, (2) Berkshire Hathaway
Primary Group and (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Except for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment
annuity products that generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paidover long time periods (creating “float,” see Investments section), Berkshire expects to achieve an underwriting profit overtime and to reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less associated incurredlosses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Underwriting profit does not includeincome earned from investments. Additionalinformation related to each of Berkshire’s underwriting groups follows.
GEICO—GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICO’s insurance subsidiaries consist of Government
Employees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company, GEICO CasualtyCompany, GEICO Advantage Insurance Company, GEICO Choice Insurance Company, GEICO Secure Insurance Company,GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company, GEICO Texas County Mutual Insurance Company and GEICO Marine
Insurance Company. The GEICO companies primarily offer private passenger automobile insurance to individuals in all 50
states and the District of Columbia. GEICO also provides insurance for motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreationalvehicles, boats and small commercial fleets and acts as an agent for other insurers who offer homeowners, renters, life andidentity management insurance to individuals who desire insurance coverages other than those offered by GEICO.K-4GEICO’s marketing isprimarily throughdirectresponse methods inwhichapplications forinsurance aresubmitted
directly to the companies via the Internet or by telephone, and to a lesser extent, through captive agents. GEICO conductsbusiness through regionalservice centersand claimsadjustment and other facilities in 39 states.
The automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. GEICO competes for private
passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies thatsell directly to the customer and with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Allstate, Progressive andUSAA. GEICO’s advertising campaigns and competitive rates contributed to a cumulative increase in voluntary policies-in-force of approximately 26.0% over the past five years. According to the most recently published A.M. Best data for 2020, thefive largest automobile insurers had a combined market share in 2020 of approximately 59.7% based on written premiums,with GEICO’s market share being the second largest at approximately 13.5%. GEICO’s written premiums in 2020 were
reducedbytheeffectsoftheGEICOGiveback Programimplemented inresponsetosignificant reductions inclaim
frequencies attributable to reduced policyholder driving during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic-related premium credit programs of other private passenger insurers may not have been reported as premium reductions,which impacts the industry data reported by A.M Best. Since the publication of that data, GEICO’s management estimates itscurrent market share is approximately 14.2%. Seasonal variations in GEICO’s insurance business are not significant.However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity ofautomobile claims.
State insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance. As a result, it is difficult for
insurance companies to differentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance, which issubstantial, tends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO’s cost-efficient direct response marketing
methods andemphasis oncustomersatisfaction enableittooffercompetitive ratesandvaluetoitscustomers.GEICO
primarily uses its own claims staff to manage and settle claims. The name and reputation of GEICO are material assets andmanagement protects those and other service marks through appropriate registrations.

Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”), offers a wide range of coverages on property, casualty, life and healthrisks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide. BHRG conducts business activities in 24 countries. Reinsurance business is
writtenthroughNICOandcertainotherBerkshire insurance subsidiaries (collectively,the“NICOGroup”)andGeneralRe
Corporation, domiciled in Delaware, and its subsidiaries (collectively the “General Re Group”). BHRG’s underwriting
operations in the U.S. are based in Stamford, Connecticut.
The type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium rates and
coverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on theperceived level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularlylargereinsurance transactions.
Property/casualtyThe NICO Group offers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share basis,
catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss basis for large or
unusual risks. The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary significantly from period to period
resulting from changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large transactions. A significant portion ofNICO Group’s annual reinsurance premium volume currently derives from a 20% quota-share agreement with InsuranceAustralia Group Limited (“IAG”) that expires July 1, 2025. IAG is a multi-line insurer in Australia, New Zealand and otherAsia-Pacificcountries.
The General Re Group conducts a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts are written
on both a quota-share and excess basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the form of treaties, and to alesser degree, on a facultative basis. General Re Group conducts business in North America primarily through GeneralReinsurance Corporation (“GRC”), which is licensed in the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is anaccredited reinsurer. GRC conducts operations in North America from its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and through
12 branch offices in the U.S. and Canada.
In North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star Indemnity
Company and Genesis Insurance Company, which offer a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and property, casualtyand professional liability coverages. Such business is marketed through a select group of wholesale brokers, managinggeneral underwriters and program administrators, and offer solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial andcaptive customers.
General Re Group’s international reinsurance business is conducted on a direct basis through General Reinsurance AG,
based in Cologne, Germany, and through several other subsidiaries and branches in numerous other countries. Internationalbusiness is also written through brokers, including Faraday Underwriting Limited (“Faraday”), a wholly-owned subsidiary.Faraday owns the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyd’s of London and provides capacity and participates in 100% of
the results ofSyndicate 435.
Life/healthThe General Re Group also conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In the U.S. and internationally, the
General Re Group writes life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care coverages. The life/healthbusiness is marketed on a direct basis. Life/health net premiums written by the General Re Group in 2021 were primarily inthe Asia Pacific, United States and Western Europe.
Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”), a subsidiary of NICO, and its affiliates write
reinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance exposures and, on a limited basis, health insurance exposures.BHLN and affiliates are parties to contracts that reinsure certain guaranteed minimum death, income and similar benefit riskson closed-blocksof variable annuity risks under reinsurancecontracts, with the mostrecent contract incepting in 2014.K-6Retroact ive reinsurance
NICO also periodically writes retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify ceding
companies against the adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred under property andcasualty policies issued in prior years. Coverages under such contracts are provided on an excess basis (above a statedretention) or for losses payable after the inception of the contract with no additional ceding company retention. Contracts arenormally subject to aggregate limits of indemnification, which can be exceptionally large in amount. Significant amounts ofasbestos, environmental and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts.
The concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract prices and
terms since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under these policies areexpected to exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is written, in part, because ofthe large amounts of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic benefit of which will be reflected through
investment results in futureperiods.
Periodic payment annuityBHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures existing annuity-like obligations. Under these
policies, BHLN receives upfront premiums and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend for decades.These policies generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers’ compensation cases of otherinsurers, known as structured settlements. Consistent with retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of-money conceptsare an important factor in establishing annuity premiums, and underwriting losses are expected from the periodic accretion oftime-valuediscountedliabilities.
Investments of insurance businesses —Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries hold significant levels of invested assets.
Investment portfolios are primarily managed by Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer. Investments include a very large
portfolio of publicly traded equity securities, which are concentrated in relatively few issuers, as well as fixed maturity
securities and cash and short-term investments. Generally, there are no targeted allocations by investment type or attempts tomatch investment asset and insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a muchgreaterproportion of equity securitiesthan is customaryin the insuranceindustry.
Invested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance and
reinsurance business (“float”). Float is the approximate amount of net policyholder funds generated through underwritingactivities that is available for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life,annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurancereceivables, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on assumed retroactive reinsurance contracts. On aconsolidated basis, float has grown from approximately $91 billion at the end of 2016 to approximately $147 billion at the
end of 2021. The cost of float can be measured as the net pre-tax underwriting loss as a percentage of average float. In each
of the three years ending December 31, 2021, Berkshire’s consolidated cost of float was negative, as its insurance businessesproduced netunderwriting gains.
Railroad Business—Burlington Northern Santa FeBurlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company
(“BNSF Railway”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF Railway had approximately 35,000employeesat the end of 2021. BNSF also operatesa relativelysmallerthird-party logisticsservices business.
In serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the United
States, BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resourceindustries. Freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common carrier published prices
or company quotations. BNSF’s financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economic
conditionsat the international,nationaland regionallevels.
BNSF’s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and southern
United States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF Railway efficiently servesmany smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF Railway has also entered intomarketing agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. For theyear ending December31, 2021, approximately 38% of freight revenues were derived from consumer products, 24% fromindustrialproducts, 23% from agriculturalproductsand 15% from coal.K-7Regulat ory Matters
BNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to its businesses. Rail operations
are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration ofthe United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), aswell as other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB hasjurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines,applications for line extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. Theoutcome of STB proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSF Railway’s business.
The DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of rail
operations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is required to transport these materials to the
extentofitscommoncarrierobligation. Stateagencies regulatesomeaspectsofrailoperations withrespecttohealthand
safety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.
Environmental MattersBNSF’s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and local
environmental regulation covering discharges to the ground or waters, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation,handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations effectively increase thecosts and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequentlyinvolve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.
Many of BNSF’s land holdings are or have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased to
commercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Under federal (in
particular, theComprehensive Environmental Response,Compensation andLiability Act)andstatestatutes,BNSFmaybe
held jointly and severally liable for cleanup and enforcement costs associated with a particular site without regard to fault or
the legality of the original conduct. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restorationor other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have beenimpacted by BNSF operations.
Consumption of diesel fuel by locomotives accounted for approximately 80% of BNSF’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”)
emissions in its baseline year of 2018. BNSF management has committed to a broad sustainability model, applying science-based approaches, that will provide a 30% reduction in BNSF’s GHG-emissions by 2030 from its baseline year of 2018.BNSF intends to continue improvements in fuel efficiency and increased utilization of renewable diesel fuel. Long-termsolutions, such as battery-electric and hydrogen locomotives, are also being evaluated and field-tested.
Competition
The business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market,
deregulated motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on price andservice levels. The presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure andminimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longercombination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive,BNSF Railway and other railroads seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity.
As railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies.
BNSF Railway’s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the United States is the Union Pacific Railroad Company.Other Class I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories servedby BNSF Railway.

PacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and local
agencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is an independent agency with broad authority toimplement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERCregulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for theexpansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention;securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has theenforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.4 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and ordersissued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant tothe Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station.
With certain limited exceptions, BHE’s domestic utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within their
service territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classes
of customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in somejurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissionshave established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, designed to allow a utility the opportunity torecover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utility’s reasonable costs of providing services, including afair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates ofPacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, includinggeneration, transmission and distribution services; however, rates are available for transmission-only and distribution-onlyservices.
Northern Powergrid (Northeast) and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) each charge fees for the use of their distribution
systems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the Gas and Electricity Markets
Authority. The current eight-year price control period runs from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2023.
AltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (“AUC”), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), the
Public Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act(Alberta). The AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency, which regulates and oversees Alberta’s electricity transmissionsector with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink’s activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operationsand financing. Under the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffsto be paid by the Alberta Electric System Operator (“AESO”) for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms andconditions governing the use of those facilities. The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada thatoversees Alberta’s integrated electrical system (“AIES”) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible for
directing the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning.
The natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. The natural gas pipeline and
storage operations of BHE GT&S, Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural GasAct and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges,terms and conditions of service; (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities,including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities; and (c) the construction and operation of liquefiednatural gas import/export facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administered bythe Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency of the DOT.Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, whichestablishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipeline
facilities.
Environmental MattersBHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate
change, renewable portfolio standards, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproductdisposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential toimpact current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations,such as the Federal Clean Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance,including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions.
The Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework for
protecting and improving the nation’s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulations
continue to be promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE’s generating facilities and require them to
reduce emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements.K-10Renewable portfoliostandards havebeenestablishedbycertainstategovernments andgenerally requireelectricity
providers to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy resources by a certain date. Utah, Oregon,
Washington, California, Iowa and Nevada have adopted renewable portfolio standards. In addition, the potential adoption ofstate or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources,may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers.
In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework for
coordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goalof limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degreesCelsius; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measuresaimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on their
emissions andprogress madeinimplementing andachieving theirnationally determined commitments;andcommits all
countries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive.In the context of the Paris Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% by 2025from 2005 levels. The Paris Agreement formally entered into force on November 4, 2016. The United States completed itswithdrawal from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of the climate agreement onJanuary 21, 2021, and the United States completed its reentry on February 19, 2021. New commitments to the ParisAgreement were announced in April 2021, with the United States pledging to cut its overall greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035.
On October 10, 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan,
which was intended to achieve an overall reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electric
generating unitsof32%below2005levels.OnJune19,2019,theEPArepealed theCleanPowerPlanandissuedthe
Affordable Clean Energy rule, which fully replaced the Clean Power Plan. In the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPAdetermined that the best system of emissions reduction for existing coal fueled power plants is heat rate improvements andidentified a set of candidate technologies and measures that could improve heat rates. Measures taken to meet the standardsof performance must be achieved at the source itself. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated theAffordable Clean Energy Rule in its entirety. In October 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of thatdecision. Arguments in the case will be held in February 2022 and a decision regarding the scope of the EPA’s authority toregulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act is expected by June 2022. Increasingly, states are adoptinglegislation and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasingamounts of clean and renewable energy.
BHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy to its
customers and on actions to mitigate its greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. BHE’s primary source of GHG emissions is the
generation of electricity from its power plants that are fueled by coal or natural gas. In managing its electricity generation,BHE works with its regulators to protect the energy and economic needs of customers by considering costs, reliability andsources of electric generation. Over the years, BHE has invested heavily in owned wind, solar and geothermal generation,with cumulative investments of $30.1 billion through 2021 and has retired 16 coal generation units. As a result, BHE hasreduced its annual GHG emissions by about 20% from 2005 levels. BHE plans to continue investing in wind, solar and otherlow-carbon generation in the future and to retire an additional 16 coal generation units between 2022 and 2030 in a reliableand cost-effective manner, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030.

Industrial productsPrecision Castparts
Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) manufactures complex metal components and products, provides high-quality
investment castings, forgings, fasteners/fastener systems and aerostructures for critical aerospace and power and energyapplications. PCC also manufactures seamless pipe for coal-fired, industrial gas turbine (“IGT”) and nuclear power plants;downhole casing and tubing, fittings and various mill forms in a variety of nickel and steel alloys for severe-service oil andgas environments; investment castings and forgings for general industrial, armament, medical and other applications; nickeland titanium alloys in all standard mill forms from large ingots and billets to plate, foil, sheet, strip, tubing, bar, rod, extrudedshapes, rod-in-coil, wire and welding consumables, as well as cobalt alloys, for the aerospace, chemical processing, oil andgas, pollution control and other industries; revert management solutions; fasteners for automotive and general industrialmarkets; specialty alloys for the investment casting and forging industries; heat treating and destructive testing services forthe investment cast products and forging industries; grinder pumps and affiliated components for low-pressure sewer
systems; critical auxiliary equipment and gas monitoring systems for the power generation industry; and metalworking tools
for the fastener market andother applications.
Investment casting technology involves a multi-step process that uses ceramic molds in the manufacture of metal
components with more complex shapes, closer tolerances and finer surface finishes than parts manufactured using othermethods. PCC uses this process to manufacture products for aircraft engines, IGT and other aeroderivative engines,airframes, medical implants, armament, unmanned aerial vehicles and other industrial applications. PCC also manufactureshigh temperature carbon and ceramic composite components, including ceramic matrix composites, for use in next-generation aerospace engines.
PCC uses forging processes to manufacture components for the aerospace and power generation markets, including
seamless pipe for coal-fired, IGT and nuclear power plants, and downhole casings and tubing pipe for severe service oil and
gas markets. PCC manufactures high-performance, nickel-based alloys used to produce forged components for aerospace and
non-aerospace applications in such markets as oil and gas, chemical processing and pollution control. These titaniumproducts are used to manufacture components for the commercial and military aerospace, power generation, energy and otherindustrial end markets.
PCC is also a leading developer and manufacturer of highly engineered fasteners, fastener systems, aerostructures and
precision components, primarily for critical aerospace applications. These products are produced for the aerospace and powerand energy markets, as well as for construction, automotive, heavy truck, farm machinery, mining and constructionequipment, shipbuilding, machine tools, medical equipment, appliance and recreation markets.
PCC has several significant customers, including aerospace original equipment manufacturers (Boeing and Airbus) and
aircraft engine manufacturer suppliers (General Electric, Rolls Royce and Pratt &Whitney). The majority of PCC’s sales are
from customer orders or demand schedules pursuant to long-term agreements. Contractual terms may provide for termination
by the customer, subject to payment for work performed. PCC typically does not experience significant order cancellations,although periodically it receives requests for delays in delivery schedules. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in2020, delayrequests increased, with deliverydates extendingin some cases beyond 2021.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic produced significant adverse effects on the PCC aerospace business in 2020
and 2021. The sudden and material reductions in air travel led to aircraft build rate reductions and customer destocking atextraordinary rates. The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX also adversely impacted 2020 and 2021 and quality issues withthe Boeing 787 negatively impacted 2021. Aircraft build rates have not recovered in any meaningful way. During 2020, PCCsignificantly reduced its worldwide workforce by about 40% to help align operations to reduced aircraft build rates. Therestructuringactions takenbegan to improvemargins in late2020 and further marginimprovements wereachieved in 2021.K-12PCCissubjecttosubstantialcompetition inallofitsmarkets.Components andsimilarproducts maybeproduced by
competitors, who use either the same types of manufacturing processes as PCC or other processes. Although PCC believes itsmanufacturing processes, technology and experience provide advantages to its customers, such as high quality, competitiveprices and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, alternative forms of manufacturing can be used toproduce many of the same components and products. Despite intense competition, PCC is a leading supplier in most of itsprincipal markets. Several factors, including long-standing customer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-artfacilities and dedicated employees, aid PCC in maintaining competitiveadvantages.
Several raw materials used in PCC products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum and
molybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in manufacturedproducts. The availability and costs of these metals may be influenced by private or governmental cartels, changes in world
politics, labor relat ions between the metal producers and their workforces and inflation.
PCC is currently subject to various federal, state and foreign environmental laws concerning, among other things,
water discharges, air emissions, waste management, toxic materials use reduction and environmental cleanup. Laws andregulations continue to evolve, and it is reasonably possible that environmental standards will become more stringent in thefuture, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change, including reporting ofgreenhouse gas emissions. As a result, it is also reasonably likely that PCC will be regularly required to make additionalexpenditures, including capital expenditures, which could besignificant, relating to environmental matters.

Retailing BusinessesBerkshire’s retailing businesses include automotive, home furnishings and several other operations that sell various
consumer products. Berkshire’s retailing businesses employed approximately 26,000 people at the end of 2021. Informationregarding each of these operations follows.
Berkshire Hathaway Automotive
Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”) and its affiliates is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United
States, currently operating 105 new vehicle franchises through 82 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitanmarkets in the United States. The dealerships sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extendedservice contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges financing for its customers
through third-party lenders. BHA operates 28 collision centers directly connected to the dealerships’ operations and owns and
operates two auto auctions and afluid maintenanceproductsdistribution company.
Dealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately 75% of
dealership-related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA currently maintains franchise agreements with 27different vehicle manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, GeneralMotors, Ford/Lincoln, Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. Approximately 90% of BHA’s annual revenues are fromdealershipsrepresenting these manufacturers.
The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private
dealership groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the pricingtransparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the
same terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed
are keydifferentiatorsin attractingcustomers.
BHA’s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The
framework agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and ownership structure ofBHA’s dealerships. Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA’s ability to acquire additionaldealerships representing those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number ofdealerships from a specific manufacturer that may be owned by BHA.K-22Individual dealershipsoperateunderfranchise agreements withthemanufacturer, whichgrantsthedealershipentitya
non-exclusive right to sell the manufacturer’s brand of vehicles and offer related parts and service within a specified market
area, as well as the right to use the manufacturer’s trademarks. The agreements contain various requirements and restrictionsrelated to the management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by themanufacturer or non-renewal for a variety of causes. States generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that providesubstantial protection to the franchisee, and it is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreementoutside of bankruptcyor with “good cause”under the applicablestatefranchise law.
BHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans as well as life and accident and
health insurance plans sold to consumers through BHA’s dealerships and third-party dealerships. BHA also developsproprietary training programs and materials and provides ongoing monitoring and training of the dealership’s finance and
insurancepersonnel.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc., 3555 Farnam Street,Omaha, NE 68131, Attn: CorporateSecretary.K-24Item 1A. Risk Factors
Berkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our” or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks
and uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are notthe only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial mayalso impair our business operations.
General Business Risks
Terrorist acts could hurt our operating businesses.
A cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations. Our
business operations could be adversely affected from such acts through the loss of human resources or destruction ofproduction facilities and information systems. We share the risk with all businesses.
Cyber security risks
We rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of our
information systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks becomemore sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in serviceinterruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assetsagainst unauthorized users and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss ofassets and criticalinformationand expose us to remediation costs and reputationaldamage.
Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disaster
recovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion at one or more of our significant
operationscouldadversely affectourresultsofoperations,financialcondition andliquidity.Additiona lly,ifweareunableto
acquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage,which couldalso have an adverseeffect on our results of operations,financialconditionand/or liquidity.
Cyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business
systems or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial marketinstability or damage to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result inbusiness interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption,unstable markets, increased security, repair or other costs, or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot bepredicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability inthe financial markets resulting from terrorism, sustained or significant cyber-attacks or war could also have a material
adverse effe ct on our abili ty to raise ca pital. We share these risks with all busine sses.
We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions.
Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of the
Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, age 91, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Boardof Directors, age 98. In 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors appointed Mr. Gregory Abel as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’snon-insurance operations and Mr. Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s insurance operations. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jaineach report directly to Mr.Buffett. Mr. Buffett continues to be responsible for major capital allocation and investmentdecisions.
If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could be
a material adverse effect on our operations. Should a replacement for Mr. Buffett be needed currently, Berkshire’s Board ofDirectors has agreed that Mr. Abel should replace Mr. Buffett. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter its
current view regarding a replacement for Mr. Buffett in the future. We believe that the Board’s succession plan, together with
the outstanding managers runningour numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk.K-25We need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses.
In our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day business
activities of our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to changing business orregulatory environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their businessplans and serving their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to recruit and retain qualified andcompetent managers and personnel could negatively affect the operating results, financial condition and liquidity of oursubsidiaries and Berkshire as a whole.
Investments are unusually concentrated in equity securities and fair values are subject to loss in value.
We concentrate a high percentage of the equity security investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively small
number of equity securities. A significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments in equity securities may producea material decline in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and our consolidated earnings.
Since a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries, significant decreases in the fair
values of these investments will produce significant declines in the statutory surplus of our insurance business. Our largestatutory surplus is a competitive advantage, and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims-paying ability ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwritingprofits.
Competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings.
Each of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we manage our
businesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitiveadvantages, many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitiveadvantages. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully
protecting and enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our
periodicoperating results in the future may decline.
Unfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to
access capital markets at a reasonable cost.
Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the general economy or the specific
industries in which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce amaterial adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and ourrailroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures and depend on having access to borrowedfunds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the costof funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected.
Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses.
The outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may
adversely affect, our operations, including our equity securities portfolio. This is or may be due to closures or restrictionsrequested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for ourproducts and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, andvolatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses.
Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results.
Over time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues,
regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed for example, the regulationof banks and other major financial institutions, products and environmental and global-warming matters. These initiatives
impact all of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative
impact on our operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant, but not controlling economicinterests. We cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financialposition, results of operations and/or cash flows.
Data privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world.
These regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our informationsystems, networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significantpenalties.K-26Risks unique to our regulated businesses
Our tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses.
When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from a
single event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a singlecatastrophe event resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employvarious disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possiblecorrelations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregateabove $10 billion. However, despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate andthat our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Additionally, various provisions of our policies, such aslimitations or exclusions from coverage, negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. Ourtolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a future period.
The degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves
may result in significant underwriting losses.
The principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and
casualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will takedecades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although webelieve that liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged forthe coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherentlyimprecise. Our estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($125billion at December 31, 2021), and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in materially lower reportedearnings.
Climate change may impact our businesses.
Climate change could cause increases in hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other risks that could produce losses
affecting our businesses. Also, failure to comply with new or existing regulations or reinterpretations of existing regulationsrelating to climate change could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results.
Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocate
capital.
Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relate
to among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capitalthat must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrictthe timing and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. U.S. state insurance regulators and
international insurance regulators are also actively developing various regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation of
large internationally active insurance groups, including regulations concerning group capital, liquidity, governance and riskmanagement. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictionson our insurance businesses may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocatecapital.
Our railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations with
respect to rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and othermatters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF’s business.Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing anyrecourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business. Complying with legislative and regulatory changesmay pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures.
BNSF derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities, particularly coal.
To the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generatingelectricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, or displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could beadversely affected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport toxic inhalation hazard chemicals and otherhazardous materials. A release of hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties andenvironmental remediation obligations. Changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF’s abilityto determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on ourresults of operations, financialcondition and/or liquidity.K-27Ourutilitiesandenergybusinessesoperated underBHEarehighlyregulatedbynumerous federal,state,localand
foreign governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamicand subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses.Regulations broadly apply and may limit management’s ability to independently make and implement decisions regardingnumerous matters including: acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring, disposing or retiring of operating assets; operatingand maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety andintegrity and environmental requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt;managing and reporting transactions between our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates; and payingdividends or similar distributions. Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation orregulations, such as those relating to air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, emissions performance standards,
climatechange,coalcombustion byproduct disposal, hazardous andsolidwastedisposal, protectedspeciesandother
environmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on ourfinancial results.
Our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network so
that transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energybusinesses also require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission anddistribution systems to meet their customers’ needs and reliability criteria. Additionally, system assets may need to beoperational for long periods of time in order to justify the financial investment. The operational or financial failure of capitalprojects may not be recoverable through rates that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capitalimprovements may be funded through debt issued by BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capital
marketsthatrestrictaccesstofundingwhenneededcouldadversely affecttheresultsofoperations, liquidityand/orcapital
resources of these businesses.

Berkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of
business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly throughreinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We donot believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results ofoperations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert ormay assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of otherpending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.K-30Item 4.

Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders $89,795 $42,521 $81,417
 Includes goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $259 million in 2021, $11.0 billion in
2020 and $435 million in 2019, which includes our share of charges recorded by Kraft Heinz.
Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses on
an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporatemanagement team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment
activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note
25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.
The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected most of our businesses beginning in March of 2020, with the effects to
date ranging from relatively minor to severe. Earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businessesdeclined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 andcontinuing in 2021, many of these businesses experienced significant recoveries in revenues and earnings, in some instancesexceeding pre-pandemic levels. However, many of our businesses were negatively affected by ongoing global supply chaindisruptions, including those attributable to major winter storms and a hurricane in North America, which contributed tohigher input costs. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at ouroperations will completely normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of
consumers and businesses we serve.
Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $728 million in 2021, $657 million in 2020
and $325 million in 2019. In each year, we generated underwriting earnings from primary insurance and underwriting lossesfrom reinsurance. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events ofapproximately $2.3 billion in 2021, $750 million in 2020 and $800 million in 2019. Underwriting results in 2021 werefavorably impacted by reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years under property and casualty contracts.Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively impacted by reductions in earned premium from the GEICO Givebackprogram, higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and severities estimates and higher losses in the life reinsurancebusiness. Underwriting results in 2020 included the effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from theGEICO Giveback program, reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss
estimates for certain commercial insurance and property and casualty reinsurance business.
After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2021 decreased 4.6% compared to 2020 and declined 8.9% in
2020 versus 2019. Earnings in 2021 and 2020 were negatively affected by declines in interest rates on our substantialholdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills.K-33Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Results of Operations (Continued)
After-tax earnings of our railroad business in 2021 rose 16.1% compared to 2020 and decreased 5.8% in 2020
compared to 2019. The earnings increase in 2021 reflected overall higher freight volumes, higher average revenue percar/unit and improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume related costs. Earnings in 2020reflected lower railroad operating revenues from lower shipping volumes, attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of ourutilities and energy business in 2021 increased 13.1% versus 2020 and increased 8.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. Theincrease in 2021 included higher earnings from the utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses, including the effects of abusiness acquisition, and from the real estate brokerage business, while the earnings increase in 2020 reflected increased taxbenefits from renewable energy and increased earnings from the realestate brokerage business.
Earnings in 2021 from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 34.0% versus 2020 and declined
11.4% in 2020 versus 2019. Many of our businesses generated significantly higher earnings in 2021 compared to 2020.While customer demand for products was relatively high during the year, several of our businesses experienced highermaterials, freight and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have varied among our businesses relative to significance and duration.
Other earnings included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $259 million in
2021, $11.0 billion in 2020 and $435 million in 2019. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded byKraft Heinz. Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Other earnings in2021 also included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of $955 million and after-tax losses of $764 million in 2020 related
to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance
Corporation (“BHFC”).
Investment and derivative gains/losses in each of the three years presented predominantly derived from our
investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains from market price changes. We believe thatinvestment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices ofequity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating theeconomic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significantvolatility in our periodic earnings.
Insurance—UnderwritingOur management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing.
Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of
Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, weevaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses.We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we considerinvestment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are notmeaningful in understandingthe periodic operating results of our insurance businesses.
The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results,
particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100 million from acurrent year catastrophic event to be significant. The significant catastrophe events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida and floodsin Europe in the third quarter, as well as Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter.
Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in
prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates underretroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $125 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our periodic underwritingresults may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation ofnon-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange ratefluctuations.K-34Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
Underwriting results of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses were negatively affected in
2021 and 2020 by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including incremental provisions forclaims and uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels. The effects of thepandemic on future periods may be affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurancecoverageand claimsand by its effects on generaleconomicactivity,which we cannot reasonablyestimateat this time.
We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health
risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire HathawayReinsuranceGroup.
Underwriting results of ourinsurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

GEICO
GEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia. GEICO markets its policies mainly by direct response methods where most customers apply for coverage directlyto the company via the Internet or over the telephone. A summary of GEICO’s underwriting results follows (dollars inmillions).

Pre-tax underwriting earnings $1,259 $3,428 $1,506
GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings in 2021 and 2020 were significantly affected by changes in average claims
frequencies. Beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, average claimsfrequencies were significantly below historical levels from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19pandemic. These effects were partially offset by higher average claims severities and lower premiums earned from theGEICO Giveback program, which provided for a 15% premium credit to all voluntary auto and motorcycle new policies orpolicies renewing between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Starting in the second quarter of 2021, average claimsfrequencies began to increase as driving by policyholders increased. In addition, average property claims severities increaseddue to increases in used vehicle valuations.K-35Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
GEICO (Continued)2021 versus 2020Premiums written in 2021 increased $3.5 billion (9.9%) compared to 2020, which included a reduction of
approximately $2.9 billion attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. Premiums earned in 2021 increased $2.6 billion(7.4%) compared to 2020. The GEICO Giveback Program reduced earned premiums by approximately $2.5 billion in 2020with the remainder of the impact included in 2021. Voluntary auto policies-in-force in 2021 were slightly higher compared to2020.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $5.0 billion (19.1%) compared to 2020. GEICO’s ratio of losses and
loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) increased 8.1 percentage points compared to 2020. The
increase in the loss ratio reflected an increase in average claims frequencies and severities and higher losses from significant
catastrophe events, partially offset by increased reductions of ultimate estimated losses for claims occurring inprior years.
Claims frequencies in 2021 were higher for all coverages, including property damage and bodily injury (thirteen to
fourteen percent range), personal injury (sixteen to seventeen percent range) and collision (twenty-one to twenty-two percentrange). Average claims severities in 2021 were also higher for property damage coverage (two to three percent range),collision coverage (fifteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury coverage (eight to ten percent range). Ultimate claimloss estimates for claims occurring in prior years were reduced approximately $1.8 billion in 2021 and $253 million in 2020,which produced corresponding reductions in losses and loss adjustment expenses. Losses incurred attributable to HurricaneIda in 2021 were $375 million, while losses in 2020 included $81 million attributable to Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S.wildfires.
Underwriting expenses decreased $199 million (3.5%) compared to 2020, reflecting lower advertising expenses.
GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) decreased 1.6 percentage points in 2021, reflectinglower nominal expenses and higher premiums earned.
2020 versus 2019Premiums written and earned in 2020 decreased $1.1 billion (3.0%) and $479 million (1.3%), respectively, compared
to 2019. The GEICO Giveback program reduced premiums written $2.9 billion and premiums earned $2.5 billion in 2020.Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 820,000 during 2020.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2020 decreased $2.9 billion (10.1%) compared to 2019. GEICO’s loss ratio
was 74.1%, a decrease of 7.2 percentage points compared to 2019. The decrease in the loss ratio reflected declines in claimsfrequencies, partly offset by increases in claims severities and the impact of lower premiums earned attributable to the
GEICO Giveback program.
Claims frequencies in 2020 were lower for property damage, bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages
(twenty-eight to thirty percent range) and collision coverage (twenty-three to twenty-four percent range) compared to 2019.Average claims severities in 2020 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (eight to ten percent range) andbodily injury coverage (twelve to thirteen percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses included net reductions of$253 million in 2020 for decreases in the ultimate loss estimates for claims occurring in prior years compared to net increasesof $42 million in 2019. Losses incurred included $81 million in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires.Therewere no losses from significant catastrophe eventsin 2019.
Underwriting expenses in 2020 increased $518 million (10.1%) compared to 2019, reflecting higher employee-related,
advertising and technology costs, partly offset by lower premium taxes. GEICO’s expense ratio in 2020 was 16.1%, an
increase of 1.6 percentage points compared to 2019. The expense ratio increase was primarily attributable to the decline in
earned premiums from the GEICO Giveback program.K-36Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Berkshire Hathaway Primary GroupThe Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions,
including healthcare professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialtycoverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary’s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance(“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARDInsurance Companies (“GUARD”), National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company(“USLI”). A summary of BH Primary underwritingresults follows (dollars inmillions).

Total losses and expenses 10,968 94.8 9,505 98.8 8,782 95.8
Pre-tax underwriting earnings $607 $110 $383
Premiums written increased $2.4 billion (23.3%) in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting increases from BH Specialty
(36%), MedPro Group (16%), NICO Primary (25%), GUARD (7%), BHHC (5%) and USLI (20%). The increases wereacross multiple coverages and occurred in several markets.
Premiums written increased $369 million (3.7%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting increased premiums written
from BH Specialty (34%) and MedPro Group (9%), partially offset by a 13% decrease in premiums written by our other
primary insurers. The decline in volume by our other primary insurers was primarily due to lower workers’ compensation andcommercial automobilevolumesand the effect of the divestiture of Applied Underwriters in October 2019.
BH Primary’s loss ratios were 70.0% in 2021, 74.1% in 2020 and 69.1% in 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expenses
attributable to significant catastrophe events were $402 million in 2021 from Hurricane Ida and Winter Storm Uri and $207million in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced $631million in 2021, $265 million in 2020 and $499 million in 2019 for net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prioryears’ loss events. Losses in 2020 also included increased liabilities of $167 million attributable to the pandemic.
BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation
insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience
significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation
outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated.
Underwriting expenses increased $485 million (20.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting the increase in business,
changes in business mix and the costs associated with new product development. The expense ratio in 2021 was relativelyunchanged versus 2020. The expense ratio in 2020 declined 2.0 percentage points compared to 2019 and reflected changes inbusiness mix and the impact of the Applied Underwriters divestiture.
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance GroupThe Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages
on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National IndemnityCompany (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also write life and health
reinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway Life
Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactivereinsurancecontracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN.K-37Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elements
in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durationsof the claim liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferredcharge amortization and discount accretion charges. We receive premiums at the inception of these contracts, which are thenavailable for investment. A summary of BHRG’s premiums and pre-tax underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).

Premiums written increased $854 million (6.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to net new business,
increased participations and improved prices on renewals and favorable currency translation effects. The increase wasprimarily attributable to property coverages. Premiums written increased $2.9 billion (27.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019. Theincrease was primarily attributable to net new business and increased participations on renewals.
Losses and loss adjustment expenses were relatively unchanged in 2021 compared to 2020, while the loss ratio
decreased 9.1 percentage points. The loss ratio was 71.9% in 2021, 81.0% in 2020 and 73.8% in 2019. Losses incurredarising from significant catastrophe events in 2021 (Hurricane Ida, flooding in Europe and Winter Storm Uri) were $2.1billion, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $718million. Losses incurred in 2020 included $667 million from significant catastrophe events (Hurricanes Laura and Sally andU.S. wildfires), losses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic of $964 million and increases in estimated ultimate liabilitiesfor losses occurring in prior years of $162 million. Incurred losses from significant catastrophe events during 2019 were $1.0billion and derived from Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis and various U.S. and non-U.S. wildfires, which were partially offset byreductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $295 million.
Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. The expense ratio in 2021 decreased 2.3
percentage points compared to 2020, primarily attributable to changes in business mix and foreign currency effects.
Underwriting expenses increased $533 million (20.6%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting the increase in premiumsearned.K-38Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Life/health premiums written decreased $227 million (3.9%) in 2021 compared to 2020. Premiums written in 2020
included $710 million from a contract that covered U.S. health risks that incepted in the fourth quarter of 2019 and did notrenew in 2021. Otherwise, premiums written in 2021 increased 9.4% versus 2020, primarily due to volume growth in theAsia Pacific region and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively affectedby significant increases in mortality in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America, attributable to the pandemic.
Life/health premiums written increased $885 million (17.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019. Approximately $480 million
of the increase was attributable to the contract covering U.S. health insurance risks, and the remainder of the increase wasprimarily from volume growth in Asia and Europe. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased life
benefits from COVID-19-related claims and from increased liabilities from changes in underlying assumptions in estimating
disability benefit liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S.long-term care business that is in run-off. Results in 2019 included a one-time pre-tax underwriting gain of $163 millionattributable toan amendmentof a yearly renewable termlife contract.
Retroactive reinsurancePre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the
estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gainsand losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of ourU.S. subsidiaries. Underwriting results included pre-tax foreign currency gains of $56 million in 2021 and losses of $139millionin 2020 and $76 millionin 2019.
Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $838 million in 2021, $1.1 billion in 2020 and
$1.2 billion in 2019. Estimated ultimate claim liabilities for contracts written in prior years were reduced $974 million in2021 and $399 million in 2020. After adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimatedtiming and amount of the future claim payments, such reductions produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $142 million in2021 and $230 million in 2020.
Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $38.3 billion at December 31, 2021, a
decline of $2.7 billion since December 31, 2020. The decline was primarily attributable to paid claims of approximately $1.9billion and the reduction in estimated ultimate claim liabilities. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactivereinsurance contracts were $10.6 billion at December 31, 2021, a decline of $1.8 billion since December 31, 2020,attributable to the effects of the changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments and periodic
amortization. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims
settlement periods.K-39Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)Periodic payment annuityPeriodic payment annuity premiums earned increased $92 million (16.3%) in 2021 compared to 2020, which decreased
$297 million (34.4%) versus 2019. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive. Our premiumvolumes in 2021 and 2020 were affected by pandemic-related delays in underlying claim settlements, which reduced thesupply of available business. Our volumes written may also change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected byprevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the levelof competition.
Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount
accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and
interest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S.subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $18 million in 2021 and losses of $67 million in2020 and $40 million in 2019.
Excluding foreign currency gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were
$526 million in 2021, $550 million in 2020 and $509 million in 2019. Pre-tax losses in 2021 were partially offset by theeffects of higher mortality and by higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts. Discounted annuityliabilities were $15.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and had aweighted average discount rateof approximately 3.9%.
Variable annuityVariable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $114 million in 2021, losses of $18
million in 2020 and earnings of $167 million in 2019. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities
markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization ofexpected profit margins. The comparative increase in underwriting earnings in 2021 was primarily attributable to the neteffects of interest rate changes and, to a lesser extent, changes in securities markets.

Interest and other investment income declined $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, which in turn, declined
$1.0 billion (49.0%) compared to 2019. These declines were primarily due to lower income from short-term investments andfixed maturity securities. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. TreasuryBills. Short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020. Low rates prevailed through 2021,which resulted in significantly lower interest income. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramountand we insist on safetyover yield with respect to short-term investments.K-40Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Insurance—Investment Income (Continued)
Dividend income included $121 million in 2021 and $26 million in 2020 from investments in preferred stock of
Berkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Dividend incomemay vary from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends fromcertain investees. Dividend income increased $365 million (8.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarilyattributable to dividends from the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% cumulative preferred stock of OccidentalPetroleumCorporation (“Occidental”) on August 8, 2019, partly offset by lower dividends from common stock investments.
Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance and
reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, includingliabilitiesunder retroactive reinsurancecontracts, life,annuity and healthinsurance benefit liabilities,unearned premiums and
other liabilities due to policyholders, reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed
under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $147 billion at December31, 2021, $138 billion at December 31, 2020 and $129 billion at December 31, 2019. Our combined insurance operationsgenerated pre-tax underwriting earnings in each of the past three years, and consequently, the average cost of float for eachyear was negative.

2021 versus 2020
Railroad operating revenues increased 11.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting higher volumes of 6.9%, as well as
a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit resulting from business mix changes and higher fuel surcharge revenueattributable to higher fuel prices. Pre-tax earnings were $7.9 billion in 2021, an increase of 15.7% from 2020. The COVID-19pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected our volumes in 2020. Revenue changes in 2021were driven by continued improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the ongoingdisruptions in the global supply chain.K-42Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Railroad (Continued)
Operating revenues from consumer products increased 13.7% in 2021 to $8.3 billion compared to 2020, reflecting
increased volumes of 7.7% and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to growth inintermodal in both international and domestic shipments driven by increased retail sales, inventory replenishments byretailers and increased e-commerce activity.
Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.0% from 2020. Volumes
increased 5.4% while average revenue per car/unit was nearly unchanged from 2020. The volume increase was primarily dueto improvement in the U.S. industrial economy, driving higher volumes in the construction and building sectors, partiallyoffset by lower petroleum volumes due to unfavorable market conditions in the energy sector.
Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 5.8% to $5.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The revenue
change reflected a volume increase of 2.9% due to higher domestic grain shipments and higher volumes of ethanol and
related commodities, as well as higher revenue per car/unit.
Operating revenues from coal increased 21.5% to $3.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 attributable to higher volumes
of 8.9% in 2021, as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase in 2021 was attributable to increasedelectricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand.
Railroad operating expenses were $13.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.3 billion (10.2%) compared to 2020. The
ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 0.7 percentage points to 60.9% in 2021 versus2020. The increase in railroad operating expenses reflected higher volumes and higher average fuel prices, partially offset bythe favorable impact of productivity improvements.
Compensation and benefits expenses increased $154 million (3.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to
increased volumes, wage inflation and health and welfare costs, partially offset by productivity improvements. Fuel expenses
increased $977 million (54.6%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Purchased service expensesincreased $79 million (4.0%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher volumes and the effects of insurance recoveries in2020 related to 2019 flooding, partially offset by improved productivity. Equipment rents, materials and other expensesincreased $79 million (4.7%) compared to 2020, due to higher volume-related costs.
2020 versus 2019Railroad operating revenues declined 11.3% in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting a 7.2% decrease in volume and a 4.5%
decrease in average revenue per car/unit. The decrease in revenue per car/unit was attributable to lower fuel surchargerevenue driven by lower fuel prices and business mix changes. The overall volume decrease was primarily due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted volumes through the first half of 2020 and caused significant economic
disruptions that adversely affected the demand for transportation services. Volumes sequentially improved during the second
half of 2020 from earlier periods and recovered overall to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year.
Pre-tax earnings were $6.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 6.3% from 2019, principally due to the negative impacts of
the pandemic on volumes. In addition, pre-tax earnings in 2019 included an operating revenue increase related to thefavorable outcome of an arbitration hearing and a retirement plan curtailment gain that is included in other expenses, net inthe preceding table. These effects were partially offset by significant improvements in 2020 in service, system velocity andcost performance compared to 2019, along with lower costs related to severe winter weather and flooding on parts of thenetwork, which negatively affected expenses and service levels in 2019.
Operating revenues from consumer products of $7.3 billion in 2020 declined 7.6% compared to 2019, primarily due to
a 6.3% decrease in average revenue per car/unit along with lower volumes. The volume decrease was primarily due to the
impact of the pandemic. Lower international and automotive volumes were offset by higher domestic intermodal volumes.
Increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and e-commerce activity produced recovery of intermodalvolumes in the second half of 2020.K-43Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Railroad (Continued)
Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of 17.0% from 2019. The decrease
was primarily attributable to the decline in volume and to a lesser extent lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumesdecreased primarily due to lower U.S. industrial production driven by the pandemic, including reduced production anddemand in the energy sector, which lowered sand and petroleum products volume, and reduced steel demand, which loweredtaconite volume.
Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 2.9% to $4.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase
was due to higher volumes, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarilydue to higher grain and meal exports, partially offset by lower ethanol and sweeteners shipments.
Operating revenues from coal decreased 28.5% to $2.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarily
due to lower volumes, as well as lower revenues per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices,
lower electricity demand driven by the pandemic, utility coal plant retirements and mild temperatures.
Railroad operating expenses declined 15.3% to $12.4 billion in 2020 as compared to 2019. The ratio of railroad
operating expenses to railroad operating revenues declined 2.9 percentage points to 61.6% in 2020 versus 2019. Railroadoperating expenses in 2020 reflected lower volume-related costs, productivity improvements, the effects of cost controlinitiatives and improved weather conditions compared to 2019.
Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $728 million (13.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to
lower employee counts associated with lower volume and improved workforce productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $1.2billion (39.2%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved fuel efficiency.Purchased services expense declined $95 million (4.6%) compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume,
improved productivity and higher insurance recoveries in 2020 related to network flooding in 2019. Equipment rents,
materials and other expense decreased $344 million (17.0%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower volume-related costs,the effects of cost controls and lowerpersonal injury and derailment expenses.

PacifiCorp operates a regulated electric utility in portions of several Western states, including Utah, Oregon and
Wyoming. After-tax earnings increased $148 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher utility margin(operating revenue less cost of sales) and increased income tax benefits from the impacts of ratemaking as well as higherproduction tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. The earnings increase waspartially offset by lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction and higher operating expenses.Operating expenses in 2021 reflected increased depreciation expense from the impacts of a deprecation study effectiveJanuary 1, 2021, and incremental costs associated with wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, offset by lowercosts associated with wildfires and asettlementagreement.K-45Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Utilities and Energy (Continued)
PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $145 million compared to 2020. The increase
reflected higher retail revenue from increases in customer volumes and higher wholesale and other revenue, partially offsetby higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Retail customer volumes increased 3.1% in 2021 as compared to2020, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts ofweather.
MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased
$65 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and increased income taxbenefits, partly offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses included incremental costs associatedwith wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service and higher natural gas distribution costs, partially offset by lower
storm restoration costs. The income tax benefit increases were mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized on new
wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, partially offset by theimpacts of ratemaking.
MEC electric utility margin increased $190 million to $2.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The electric utility
margin increase was attributable to higher operating revenue from increases in retail and wholesale customer volumes, aswell as favorable wholesale prices, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Electric retailcustomer volumes increased 5.8% in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to increased usage by certain industrialcustomers and the favorable impacts of weather.
NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $29 million in
2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected lower operating expenses, lower net interest and finance expense and lowerincome tax expense from the impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by lower electric utility margin. The decreases in
operating expenses were mainly due to lower earnings sharing, partially offset by higher depreciation expense from
additional assets placed in-service.
NV Energy’s electric utility margin decreased $97 million to $1.6 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease was
primarily due to revenue reductions from lower base tariff general rates in 2021 and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020,partially offset by a 3.3% increase in electric retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes wasprimarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, higher customer usage and the favorable impacts ofweather.
Northern Powergrid’s after-tax earnings increased $46 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher
tariff rates and units distributed, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs, lower pension expense and favorable foreigncurrency exchange rate movements in 2021, partially offset by the impact of increases in the United Kingdom corporate
income tax rate. Earnings in 2021 included deferred income tax expense of $109 million related to the enactment in June
2021 of an increase in the income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. Earnings in 2020 included deferredincome tax expense of $35 million related to the enactment in July 2020 of an increase in the income tax rate from 17% to19%, effective April 1, 2020.
Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $246 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 included
BHE GT&S for the full year compared to two months in 2020. The incremental earnings in 2021 from BHE GT&S were$211 million. In addition, earnings in 2021 reflected the effects of higher margins on natural gas sales and highertransportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas due to increased demand from the February 2021 winter storms, partiallyoffset by lower transportation revenue primarily due to lower volumes for the remainder of the year.
Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings in 2021 decreased $17 million compared to 2020. The decrease was mainly
due to a decline in wind tax equity investment earnings of $56 million, which included increased losses from pre-existing tax
equity investments of $165 million, largely attributable to the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by increasedincome tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. Earnings in 2021 from otherenergy projects increased due to higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects and a transmissioninvestment, as well as favorable foreign currency exchange ratemovements in 2021.
Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $12 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was due to a
comparative increase in closed brokerage transaction volumes in 2021, partially offset by lower funded mortgage volume dueto a decrease in refinance activity.
Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings increased $15 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was
primarily due to favorable comparative state income tax benefits and higher earnings from non-regulated energy services,
offset by higher operating expenses and higher interest expense from corporate debtissued in 2020.K-46Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Utilities and Energy (Continued)
2020 versus 2019PacifiCorp after-tax earnings decreased $32 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease reflected higher operating
expenses and net interest expense, partially offset by increased production tax credit benefits driven by repowered windprojects placed in-service, higher utility margin and higher other income. The increase in operating expenses was largely dueto costs associatedwith wildfires, a settlementagreement and pension benefits.
PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $47 million compared to 2019. The increase reflected
higher operating revenue from an increase in average retail prices and lower generation and purchased power costs, partiallyoffset by lower operating revenue from a decline in retail customer volumes. The decline in retail customer volumes was dueto the impacts of the pandemic, partly offset by an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts of
weather.
MEC after-tax earnings increased $37 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected increased income tax
benefits, primarily from production tax credits, driven by repowered and new wind projects placed in-service, and the effectsof ratemaking. These effects were partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service,higher netinterest expense,lower other incomeand lower electricand naturalgas utilitymargins.
MEC electric utility margin decreased $10 million to $1.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The electric utility margin
decrease was attributable to lower operating revenue from unfavorable wholesale prices and price impacts from changes inretail sales mix. These effects were mostly offset by lower generation and purchased power costs and higher operatingrevenue from a 1.2% increase in retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily dueto increased usage by certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. Natural gas utility margin
decreased$9 million in2020 compared to 2019, dueto the unfavorableimpacts of weather.
NV Energy after-tax earnings increased $45 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher electric
utility margin and lower income tax expense from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher operatingexpenses. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher earnings sharing accruals for customers at NevadaPower Company and higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service.
NV Energy electric utility margin increased $100 million to $1.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was
primarily due to higher operating revenue from a 1.5% increase in electric retail customer volumes, including distribution-only service customers and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. The increase in electric retail customer volumeswas primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic.
Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings decreased $55 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The earnings decrease
reflected write-offs of gas exploration costs and higher income tax expense, in large part from a change in the United
Kingdom corporate income tax rate, partially offset by lower pension costs and interest expense.
Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $106 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily
due to $73 million of earnings from BHE GT&S, the favorable impact of a rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas andhigher transportation volumeand rates, partially offset by higher depreciation, operating expenses and interest expenses.
Other energy business after-tax earnings in 2020 increased $89 million compared to 2019. The increase was primarily
due to increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercialoperation, partially offset by lower operating revenue and higher operating expenses from geothermal and natural gas units.
Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $215 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected
higher earnings from mortgage and brokerage services. The increase in earnings from mortgage services was attributable to
higher refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment and the earnings increase from brokerage services was
due to an increase of 13.1% in closed transaction dollar volume.
Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $113 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was
primarily due to higher interest expense and lower state income tax benefits.K-47Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Industrial products
The industrial products group includes metal products for aerospace, power and general industrial markets (Precision
Castparts Corp. (“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMCInternational Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturingand service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tankcontainer and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestockand agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer andLiquidPower Specialty Products).
2021 versus 2020Revenues of the industrial products group in 2021 increased $2.5 billion (9.8%) from 2020. Pre-tax earnings increased
$714 million (19.0%) compared to 2020 and pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was 15.9%, an increase of
1.3 percentage points compared 2020.
PCC’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, a decrease of $853 million (11.6%) compared to 2020. Historically, PCC
has derived significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to materialdeclines in commercial air travel and original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) aircraft production in 2021 and 2020.While commercial air travel increased in both the U.S. and international markets in 2021 versus 2020, demand remains wellbelow pre-pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth andstrong demand for travel, however, the recovery has been uneven between domestic and international markets. Air trafficrecovery will continue to be impacted by the pandemic, though likely more on a seasonal or localized basis as the pandemicshifts to an endemic phase. Near term recovery in build rates will lag recovery in air travel due to the significant finished
goods inventory following quality issues with theBoeing 737 and Boeing 787 planes and industry supply chain issues.
PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 78.8% compared to 2020. The increase reflects the
actions taken by management to resize, restructure and improve operations and to prepare for more normalized demand forPCC’s products, as well as from a decline in restructuring costs. We do not expect significant increases in PCC’s aerospacerevenues or earnings to occur in the near term, primarily due to the relatively low aircraft build rates related to Boeing’ssignificant inventory levels and the ongoing impact of theCOVID-19 pandemic on commercial air travel.
Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2020. The increase reflects higher
average selling prices, driven by significant increases in materials and other manufacturing costs, as well as slightly highervolumes. Sales volumes in the Additives product lines were negatively affected by severe winter storms in February 2021,which caused the temporary shut-down of several U.S. facilities, as well as other temporary production shut-downs in the
second half of 2021.
Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 decreased 50.8% compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 included significant losses
related to a fire in June 2021 at a facility of Chemtool Incorporated, a Lubrizol subsidiary, located in Rockton, Illinois andimpairment charges in the second half of 2021 related to an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials productlines. These losses and charges aggregated $257 million in 2021. Earnings in 2021 were also negatively impacted by theeffects of accelerating raw material costs and the previously mentioned temporary shut-down of Additives productionfacilities, which resulted in lost sales and incremental manufacturing costs.
Marmon’s revenues were $9.8 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.1 billion (27.9%) compared to 2020. Revenues in 2021
from the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups increased 54% over 2020, accounting for over halfof the aggregate increase in Marmon’s revenues. These increases were attributable to higher volumes and prices, including
the impact of significantly higher average copper and metal prices. Revenues of most of Marmon’s other groups, particularly
those serving the construction, automotive, heavy-duty truck and restaurant markets, also increased in 2021, reflecting highervolumes and favorable foreign currency translation effects. These increases were partially offset by the impact of divestituresand business closures in the Water Technologies and Retail Solutions groups and lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasinggroup, reflecting fewer railcars on lease and changes in lease mix.
Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 increased 40.3% compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to earnings
increases in the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups due to higher volumes and average margins.Earnings of several other business groups also increased attributable to higher sales volumes, sales mix changes and lowerrestructuring charges, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Water Technologies groups.K-49Management’s Discussion and An alysis (Continued)
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)
Industrial products (Continued)
IMC’s revenues increased 19.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting impro ving business conditions in most
geographic regions and favorable foreigncurrency translation effects. IMC’s pre-tax earningsincreased 47.7% in 2021 versus
2020, primarily attributable to higher customer demand, improved manufa cturing efficiencies, operating cost management
saving initiatives and favorable foreign currencytranslation effects.
2020 versus 2019Revenues of the industrial products group in 2020 declined $4.9 billion (1 6.1%) from 2019, while pre-tax earnings
declined $1.9 billion (33.4%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenu es for the group was 14.6% in 2020 compared to
18.4% in 2019.
PCC’s revenues were $7.3 billion in 2020, a decrease of $3.0 billion (28.9% ) compared to 2019. The COVID-19
pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and ai rcraft production. Airlines responded to the
pandemic by delaying delivery of aircraft orders or, in some cases, cancel ling aircraft orders, resulting in significant
reductions in build rates by aircraft manufacturers and significant inve ntory reduction initiatives by PCC’s customers.
Further, Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft production issues contributed to the d eclines in aerospace product sales across the
industry in 2020. These factors resulted in significant declines in deman d for PCC’s aerospace products in 2020. PCC’s sales
of products for power markets increased 2.2% in 2020, primarily driven by i ncreases in industrial gas turbine products, offset
byreductionsinoil andgasproducts.
PCC’s pre-tax earnings were $650 million in 2020, a decrease of 64.5% compa red to 2019, which reflected the decline
in aerospace product sales as well as increased manufacturing inefficien cies attributable to lower volumes. In response to the
effects of the pandemic, PCC took aggressive restructuring actions to res ize operations in response to reduced expected
volumes in aerospace markets. PCC’s worldwide workforce was reduced by ab out 40% from the end of 2019. PCC recorded
restructuring, inventory and fixed asset charges of approximately $295 m illion in 2020. Earnings as a percentage of revenues
were negatively impacted in 2020 due to inefficiencies associated with al igning operations to reducedaircraft build rates.
Lubrizol’s revenues were $5.95 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.0% compare d to 2019. The decline was primarily
attributable to lower volumes from economic effects of the pandemic and a f ire at an Additives manufacturing, blending and
storage facility in Rouen, France at the end of the third quarter of 2019, wh ich resulted in the temporary suspension of
operations. Revenues in 2020 also reflected lower selling prices, partly offset by favorable changes in sales mix. Lubrizol’s
consolidated volume for the year declined 9% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to declines in the Additives and Engineered
Materials productlines, partlyoffset by higher volumes inLife Science p roducts.
Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were approximately $1.0 billion, ess entially unchanged compared to 2019. The
effects of lower sales volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire, and lower average selling prices were offset by
lower average raw material costs, lower operating expensesandinsurance recoveries in 2020 associated with theRouen fire.
Marmon’s revenues were $7.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of $681 million (8. 2%) compared to 2019. Excluding the
effects of business acquisitions, revenues decreased in essentially all groups, primarily attributable to lower demand from the
effects of the pandemic. The largest effects were experienced in the Trans portation Products and Foodservice Technologies
groups. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower metal prices in the Metal Services group and the effect of business
divestitures in 2019. Declines in oil prices in 2020 also adversely affect ed demand and revenues in the Rail & Leasing and
Crane Services groups. Marmon acquired the Colson Medical companies on Oc tober 31, 2019, which represents Marmon’s
Medical group.
Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 decreased $312 million (24.3%) compare d to 2019. The decrease reflected the
declines in revenues and increased restructuring charges. Restructurin g initiatives were initiated in response to the lower
product demand,particularly in thesectors most impacted by the pandemic .K-50Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

IMC’s revenues declined 13.2% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting negative economic effects from the pandemic on
demand for cutting tools in most geographic regions, partly offset by the effects of business acquisitions. IMC’s pre-taxearnings declined 26.6% in 2020 versus 2019, attributable to declines in sales and margins due to lower volumes and tochanges in sales mix.
Building productsThe building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial
services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks andmasonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercialconstructionand engineeringproducts and systems (MiTek).
2021 versus 2020
Revenues of the building products group increased $3.7 billion (17.6%) in 2021 and pre-tax earnings increased $532
million (18.6%) compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.6% in 2021 and 13.5% in 2020.During 2021, our businesses experienced strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. We also experienced variousforms of supply chain disruptions, which affected the general economy, and contributed to considerable raw material andlogisticscost inflationand supply constraints.
Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $10.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.9 billion (22.2%) over 2020.
Revenues from home sales increased $1.8 billion (26.5%) in 2021 to approximately $8.3 billion, reflecting increased revenueper home sold, changes in sales mix and a net increase in new units sold. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 15.8% in2021, while factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 1.5%. Site-built home unit sales were constrained by longer
construction periods arising from supply chain constraints and labor shortages. Financial services revenues, which include
mortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 7.8% in 2021 comparedto 2020. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, anincreaseof approximately$1.7 billion comparedto December31, 2020.
Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $440 million (35.3%)
compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 reflected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net interest incomeand lower provisions for expected credit losses, partially offset by the impact of rising manufacturing and supply chain costs.The provision for expected credit losses in 2020 was unusually high and included provisions for the expected impact of theCOVID-19 pandemic. The comparative decline in the provision for expected credit losses was due to fewer actual andanticipated loanforeclosures.
Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2021, an increase of
14.4% versus 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by significantly higher input andsupply chain costs, as well as higher unit volumes for paint and coatings, flooring, insulation, roofing and other engineeredproducts.
Pre-tax earningsof the other building products businesses were approximately$1.7 billion in2021, an increase of 5.7%
over 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues was 11.8% in 2021, a 1.0 percentage point decrease compared to2020. While customer demand in 2021 was generally strong, reduced availability of materials and other product inputs fromsupply chain disruptions negatively affected sales and operating results. In addition, higher costs for raw materials and freightand higher restructuringand impairmentcharges contributedto the reductionin our pre-tax marginrates.
2020 versus 2019
Revenues of the buildingproducts group increased $917 million(4.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-taxearnings
increased $222 million (8.4%) over 2019. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.5% in 2020 and 13.0% in2019.K-51Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)
Building products (Continued)Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $8.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $1.3 billion (17.1%) over 2019. The
increase was primarily due to increases in home sales of $1.0 billion (18.4%), driven by increases in units sold and revenueper home sold and by changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 28.6% in 2020 over 2019, while revenueper home increased slightly. Manufactured home unit sales increased 2.8% in 2020. Financial services revenues increased13.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, attributable to increased loan originations and average outstanding loan balances. Loanbalances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $17.1 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to$15.9 billion as of December 31, 2019.
Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.25 billion in 2020, an increase of $152 million (13.9%)
compared to 2019. The earnings increase reflected higher earnings from home sales, partly offset by higher materials costs,
which lowered manufactured housing gross margin rates. Earnings in 2020 also benefitted from increased interest income,lower interest expense and higher earnings from mortgage services, partly offset by increased provisions for credit andinsurance losses.
Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $12.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of
2.6% versus 2019. The revenue decrease reflected lower flooring volumes, in part attributable to the negative effects of theCOVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increased paint and coatings volumes, including volumes from a new agreementwith Ace Hardware Stores, and increased volumes in residential markets.
Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 4.6%
over 2019. The earnings increase reflected the effects of lower average input costs, operating cost containment efforts and
lower facilities closurecosts.
Consumer productsThe consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations
(including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performancealkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products(Richline).
2021 versus 2020Consumer products revenues increased $3.4 billion (28.0%) in 2021 versus 2020. Revenues from Forest River
increased 40.2% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by a 27.6% increase in recreational vehicle unit sales and higher averageselling prices, primarily due to significant increases in manufacturing costs.
Revenues of several of our other consumer products businesses were significantly higher in 2021 as compared to 2020.
The initial impacts of the pandemic in the first half of 2020 from temporary retail store closures and reduced demand had asevere impact on most of these businesses. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 25.3% in 2021 compared to 2020,reflecting significant increases in unit sales, partly attributable to inventory restocking by certain customers, and fromincreased consumer demand. Revenues from Richline increased 39.9%, whilerevenues from Duracell increased 2.4%.
Consumer products pre-tax earnings increased $585 million (41.9%) in 2021 compared to 2020 and as a percentage of
revenues in 2021 increased 1.2 percentage points to 12.7%. The increase reflected significant earnings increases at many ofour businesses, driven by Forest River, the apparel and footwear businesses, Richline and Larson-Juhl. However, ourconsumer products businesses, particularly the apparel and footwear businesses, also experienced significant cost increasesand supply chain disruptions, causing pre-tax margins in the second half of 2021 to be 1.1 percentage points lower than in the
first half of the year.

Consumer products (Continued)The comparative increase in revenues reflected increases from Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower
apparel and footwear revenues. Forest River revenues increased 11.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily attributable to asignificant increase in recreational vehicle unit sales over the last half of the year and changes in sales mix. Unit sales in thesecond half of 2020 increased 31% over the second half of 2019. Revenues from Duracell increased 10.0% in 2020 comparedto 2019, reflecting the effects of changes in sales mix and increased volume. Apparel and footwear revenues declined 6.1% in2020 compared to 2019.
Apparel and footwear sales volumes in the first half of 2020, particularly in the second quarter, reflected the negative
effects of the pandemic, which included retail store closures, reduced or cancelled orders and pandemic-related disruptions at
certain manufacturing facilities. Sales recovered somewhat in the second half of 2020, attributable to higher consumer
demand and inventory restocking by retailers. Brooks Sports revenues were higher, partly attributable to the effect of thereduced salesin 2019 that were caused by shipping delays ata new distribution facility.

Revenues from TTI increased 37.4% in 2021 versus 2020, primarilyattributable to significantly higher volumes across all significant markets and product categories, and to a lesser extent,higher average prices and changes in sales mix. Customer demand accelerated throughout 2021, as customers attempted tomaintain adequate inventories in response to high demand for components in end products and effects of supply chaindisruptions. Revenues from aviation services increased 27.5% in 2021 over low 2020 levels, primarily due to higher traininghours (24%) and customer flight hours (70%).

TTI’s earnings increase was primarily attributable to the increases in salesvolumes, as well as from improved operating cost leverage and changes in sales mix. The increase in earnings from aviationservices was attributable to the favorable effects of higher volume, changes in business mix, increased operating efficiencies,lower impairment charges and the effects of past restructuring efforts, partly offset by higher subcontractor costs attributableto the significant increase in flight demand.
2020 versus 2019Service group revenues declined $1.15 billion (8.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings decreased $81
million (4.8%). Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 13.0% in 2020, an increase of 0.5 percentage
points compared to 2019.
The aggregate revenues of NetJets and FlightSafety in 2020 declined $816 million (13.5%) compared to 2019,
reflecting lower demand for air travel and aviation services attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. NetJets experienced adecline in customer flight hours of 27% and FlightSafety’s commercial and corporate simulator training hours declined 30%from 2019. The comparative service group revenue decline also reflected the disposition of the newspaper operations inMarch of 2020 and lower revenues from CORT, which was driven by lower demand attributable to the pandemic. Thesedeclines were partially offset by revenue increases from TTI and WPLG.
The decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from NetJets, TTI and CORT and the divestiture of the newspaper
operations, partly offset by higher earnings from XTRA, Business Wire, WPLG and FlightSafety. TTI’s earnings decline
reflected lower average gross margin rates, attributable to product mix changes and sales price pressures deriving from ample
inventory availability. The decline at NetJets was primarily attributable to increased asset impairment charges andrestructuring costs, partly offset by lower general and administrative expenses and a slight net increase in margins. Thedecline at CORT was driven by lower revenues, partly offset by the effects of cost control initiatives. The increase atFlightSafety was attributable to the effects of contract losses of approximately $165 million recorded in 2019 with respect toan existing government contract and cost control efforts in 2020, which more than offset significantly lower earnings fromcommercial andcorporate training services.
RetailingOur largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), representing 62% of our combined
retailing revenue in 2021. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair
services and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluid
maintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (NebraskaFurniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. Thehome furnishings group represented 21% of the combined retailing revenues in 2021.
Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s
Candies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies,school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based inGermany.K-54Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Retailing (Continued)2021 versus 2020Retailing group revenues in 2021 increased $3.1 billion (19.8%) compared to 2020. BHA’s revenues increased 19.0%
in 2021 compared to 2020, with vehicle sales, service and repair, and finance and service contract revenues each increasingversus 2020. Revenues from vehicle sales in 2021 increased $1.7 billion (20.7%) versus 2020, primarily due to higheraverage selling prices, as well as a 2.7% increase in units sold. However, new vehicle unit sales in the second half of 2021declined 18% compared to the second half of 2020, reflecting significant new vehicle supply shortages at OEMs attributableto the global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues increased 22.0%in 2021 as compared to 2020, attributable to higher consumer demand and higher average selling prices, driven by higher
inventory and freight costs.
Pre-tax earnings in 2021 of the retailing group increased $781 million (76.0%) from 2020 and the pre-tax margin rate
increased 3.0 percentage points to 9.5%. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily dueto increased vehicle sales margins and higher earnings from finance and service contract activities. In addition, earnings in2021 benefitted from lower floorplan interest expense, attributable to significant declines in inventory levels, and fromongoing operating cost controlefforts.
Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased 67.6% in 2021 versus 2020, reflecting generally higher average
gross margin rates and sales mix changes and cost control efforts, partly offset by higher personnel costs. Aggregate pre-taxearnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $321 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The initial effects of thepandemic in 2020 were severe for most of our other retailers due to the restricted operations at many of those businesses.
Results in 2021 also benefitted from relatively strong consumer demand and the effects of restructuring efforts in 2020.
2020 versus 2019Retailing group revenues in 2020 declined $159 million (1.0%) compared to 2019. The spread of COVID-19 resulted
in the temporary closures or restricted operations at several of our retailing businesses and effected consumer spendingpatterns during 2020. The severityand duration of the effects from the pandemic varied widely at our retail operations.
BHA’s revenues decreased 2.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. BHA’s revenues in 2020 reflected decreases in new and
pre-owned vehicle sales of 2.6%, as well as lower vehicle service and repair revenues. Home furnishings revenues wereessentially unchanged in 2020 compared to 2019. The retailing group experienced lower revenues in the first half of 2020,attributable to restricted store hours, which were substantially offset by increased revenues over the second half of the year.However, supply chain disruptions had a negative effect on obtaining product at certain times, which negatively affected
sales levels.
The effects of the pandemic contributed to significantly lower sales in 2020 for our jewelry stores, See’s Candies and
Oriental Trading Company, which were more than offset by significant revenue increases from Pampered Chef and Louis.Sales volumes generally increased and operating results improved beginning in the latter part of the second quarter as ouroperations slowly reopened.
Retail group pre-tax earnings increased $154 million (17.6%) in 2020 from 2019. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased
37.7%, primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower floorplan interest expense and higheraverage gross sales margin rates. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased 1.1% in 2020compared to 2019, reflecting higher earnings from the home furnishings businesses and from Pampered Chef, which weresubstantially offset by lower earnings fromour other retailing operations.
Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased $79 million (36%) in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting generally higher
average gross margin rates, sales mix changes and fewer sales promotions and lower advertising and other operatingexpenses. Certain of our other operations, including Pampered Chef and Louis experienced significant earnings increases in2020, while others, including See’s Candies and Oriental Trading Company, experienced significant declines driven by thenegative effects of the pandemic.K-55Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

Retailing (Continued)McLaneMcLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”) operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-food
consumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operatesbusinesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservicebusinesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, includingWalmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised about 63% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2021with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers couldhave an adverse impacton periodic revenues and earnings.
2021 versus 2020
Revenues increased $2.6 billion (5.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues from the grocery business increased 1.5%
compared to 2020, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 13.1% and 17.8%, respectively.The foodservice business was significantly impacted by pandemic-related restaurant closures in 2020.
Pre-tax earnings decreased $21 million (8.4%) in 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease reflected significant
increases in personnel, contract transportation and fuel costs, which more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales andslightly higher gross sales margins. McLane’s grocery and food service operations were significantly affected in 2021 byupstream supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, which contributed to higherinventory costs reflected in a LIFO inventory reserve increase of $130 million, and disruptions in inventory availability.These upstream supply chain effects, together with the truck driver and warehouse personnel shortages that we are
experiencing, adversely affected our customer service levels and reduced our operating efficiencies. In response, our hiring
and wage and benefits costs increased significantly in 2021. The increase in fuel expense was primarily attributable tosignificant increases in petroleum prices. We expect the current difficult operating environment to continue through 2022.
2020 versus 2019Revenues declined $3.6 billion (7.2%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was attributable to COVID-19-related
restaurant closures (particularly in the casual dining category) in the foodservice business and lower sales in certain productcategories within the grocery business. McLane operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year and 2020 included 52 weeks comparedto 53 weeks in 2019. Otherwise, revenues declined 5.2% in the grocery business and 7.7% in the foodservice business in2020 as compared to 2019.
Pre-tax earnings decreased $37 million (12.8%) in 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease included the
effects of increased LIFO inventory reserves of $22 million, credit and inventory losses of $12 million in the foodservice
operations and the impact of lower sales.

Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses (Continued)
Investment gains/lossesUnrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities are included
in our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of ourequity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses included netunrealized gains of approximately $76.4 billion in 2021, $55.0 billion in 2020 and $69.6 billion in 2019 attributable tochanges in market prices of equity securities we held at the end of each year. In each year, we also recorded pre-tax gains andlosses from market value changes during each year on equity securities sold during such year, including gains of $1.0 billionin 2021, losses of $14.0 billion in 2020 and gains of $1.6 billion in 2019. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold,which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $3.6 billion in
2021, $6.2 billion in 2020 and $3.2 billion in 2019.
We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are
often meaningless in terms of understanding our periodic consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economicperformance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings, including the changes in market pricesfor equity securities, in anygiven period has little analytical or predictive value.
Derivative contract gains/lossesDerivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities,
which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. A vast majority of these contracts have since expired.Contracts comprising 63% of the remaining notional value as of December 31, 2021 will expire in the first quarter of 2022.The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and, historically, were significant,
primarily due to the volatility of underlying equity markets. As of December 31, 2021, the intrinsic value of our equity index
put option contracts was near zero and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $99 million. Our ultimatepayment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsicvalue as defined under the contracts. The pre-tax gains and losses in each of the past three years reflected changes in theequity index values and shorter remaining contract durations. Settlement payments to counterparties over the past three yearswere insignificant.

After-tax acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in
connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. Such charges arise primarily from the amortization orimpairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible assetimpairments in 2020 included after-tax charges of $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiableintangible assets that were recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Other Critical AccountingPolicieson page K-62 for additionaldetails.
Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt and
BHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains andlosses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period
can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.
Berkshire corporate items consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, otherintercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocatedincometaxes.
Financial Condition
Our consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base.
Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 was $506.2 billion, an increase of $63.0 billion since December 31,2020. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $89.8 billion and included after-tax gains on our investments ofapproximately $61.6 billion. Over each of the last three years, investment gains and losses from changes in the market pricesof our investmentsin equity securitiesproduced exceptionalvolatility in our periodic earnings.
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B
shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman ofthe Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify amaximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program isexpected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidatedcash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity willalways be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $27.1 billion in 2021 to repurchase shares of its Class A andB common stock.
At December 31, 2021, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of
$143.9 billion, which included $119.6 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities
(excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $367.2 billion. Our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2021 included
approximately$14.4 billionof investmentsthat maturein 2022 and 2023.
Our consolidated borrowings at December 31, 2021 were $114.3 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshire
parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. Expected principal and interest payments related to ourconsolidated borrowings in each of the next five years are (in billions): $10.2 in 2022; $14.6 in 2023; $9.7 in 2024; $9.9 in2025; and $8.7 in 2026.
Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 was $21.4 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion since
December 31, 2020, which was primarily due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on Euro and JapaneseYen denominated debt. In 2021, Berkshire repaid Euro and U.S. Dollar denominated debt aggregating approximately $2.2billion of maturing senior notes and issued Euro and Yen denominated senior notes aggregating approximately $2.2 billion
with maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2041 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. In January 2022, Berkshire
repaid $600 million of maturing senior notes and issued ¥128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes withmaturity dates ranging from2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%.
Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $17.9 billion at December 31,
2021, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $13.1 billion.BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held forlease by our railcar leasing business. In 2021, BHFC repaid $750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $750 million of2.5% senior notes due in 2051. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal andinterest.K-58Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Financial Condition (Continued)
BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2020.
During 2021, BNSF repaid $1.54 billion of debt and issued $1.55 billion of debentures with a weighted average interest rateof 3.1% with maturity dates in 2051 and 2052. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $51.8 billion atDecember 31, 2021, a decrease of $382 million since December 31, 2020. In 2021, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new termdebt of approximately $2.2 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2052 and repaid term debt of approximately$2.5 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries.
In each of the past three years, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of approximately
$39 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $13.3billion in 2021, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $9.5
billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly
make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures of these twooperations will approximate $11.1 billion in 2022.
Contractual Obligations
We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to
counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating leaseliabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next fiveyears are (in billions): $1.6 in 2022;$1.5 in 2023; $1.4 in 2024; $1.2 in 2025; and $1.2 in 2026.
We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including
amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $125 billion at December 31, 2021. We currently forecast claim
payments in 2022 of approximately $29 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to 2022. Additionally, we estimate net
payments of approximately $3 billion in 2022 for life, health and annuity benefits under contracts. However, the timing andamount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actualpayments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recordedin our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipatethat these payments will be funded by operating cash flows.
Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations,
are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods aredelivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2021, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligationsprimarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE andBNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. We estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the
next five years of approximately $19 billion, including $8 billion in 2022. We also have an agreement to acquire an
additional 41.4% of Pilot in 2023 and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries.Reference is made to Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding thesecommitments.
Critical Accounting Policies
Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our
Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significantdegrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likelybe adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion ofour principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2021 follows.
Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim
liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheetdate. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claimreporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment andsettlement process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities, which may require significant judgmentsand assumptions.
As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for claims not yet
reported. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usuallyhave relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for
decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal
environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails.K-59Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Our consolidated claim liabilities, including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts, as of December 31, 2021
were approximately $125 billion, of which 80% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group.Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaidlosses of these businesses follows.
GEICOGEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2021, GEICO’s gross unpaid
losses were $23.9 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $22.7 billion. GEICO’s claim reservingmethodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liabilityestimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a
combinationof severalactuarial estimation methods, includingBornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies.
Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and
personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case developmentestimates. As of December31, 2021, case development liabilities averaged approximately 34% of the case reserves. Weselectcase developmentfactors through analysis of the overalladequacy of historicalcase liabilities.
Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims
expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-ageprojections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the numberof unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claimcounts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are
difficult to apply.
We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure
models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in agiven period and projects theultimate cost.
Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2020 were reduced by $1.8 billion during 2021, which produced a
corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2021 reflect themost recent frequency and severity estimates. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actualfrequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated.
With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will change
by at least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31,
2021. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $290 million increase or
decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forcesthat would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages todiffer in the same direction.

Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages
written primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple linesof business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances,we allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internalestimates.
In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information
received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms.Reinsurance contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly thanprimary insurance policies.
The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess
contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information withrespect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claimbasis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently providereliableIBNR loss estimates.
Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. In the U.S., such reporting is
generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of theU.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days afterthe end of the annual period. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, furtherdelays in claims reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the
type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance
coverage, and for other reasons.
As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so
there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintaincertain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms.Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business,thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally ariseconcerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiationwith the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution
processes. Therearenocoveragedisputesatthistimeforwhichanadverseresolutionwouldlikelyhaveamaterialimpacton
our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance assumed requires evaluation of loss information received from our
clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies’ reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reportedcase losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2021, our case lossestimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $700 million for certain legacy workers’ compensationclaims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which maycause us to adjust our case estimates.
Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, we use a variety of
actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industrydata and other benchmarks, as appropriate. The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and
management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling
practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generallyfall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of thefollowing categories:K-61Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)Paid and incurred loss development methods – these methods consider expected case loss emergence and development
patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are notlimited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claimreviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; andlegal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case lossemergence patterns.
Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and
expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate
of the expected unpaid or unreported losses.
Frequency and severity methods – these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and
the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processesand techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate costassociated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses.
Additional analysis – in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis,
determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of ananticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward overtime to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy ofthe expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised
to include estimates of known major catastrophe events.
Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the
paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certaincatastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Ourprocesses and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment ofthe ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patternsof past losses.
For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of
the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature yearsreflecting the paid orincurred development pattern indications.
In 2021, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced
estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $136 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail ofthe expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.0billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible forthese assumptions to increase atthese rates.
For other casualty losses, excluding asbestos, environmental, and other latent injury claims, we reduced estimated
ultimate liabilities for prior years’ events by approximately $375 million in 2021. For certain significant casualty and generalliability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and inthe expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $950 million, although outcomes of greater than or less than $950 million are possible given
the diversification in worldwide business.
The change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding
amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not significant in 2021. Net liabilities for such claims wereapproximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2021. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to thechanging legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, newclaims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.K-62Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Property and casualty losses (Continued)
Retroactive reinsuranceOur retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities
associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures. We expect theclaim-tails to be very long. As of December 31, 2021, gross unpaid losses were $38.3 billion and deferred charges were $10.6billion.
Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that
maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $54 billion. Absent significantjudicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe itunlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimated
gross liability.
We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing
our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses undervarious scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. Wethen monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available informationconcerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significantdeviations from expected results are revealed.
Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our
estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.3 billion at December 31, 2021. We do not consistently receive
reliabledetaileddataregarding asbestos, environme ntalandlatentinjuryclaimsfromallcedingcompanies,particularlywith
respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying
loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we developestimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarilyconsider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reformand legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities.
We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $974 million in 2021,
which after the changes in related deferred charges, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $142 million. In 2021, we paid losses andloss adjustment expenses of $1.9 billion with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts.
In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charges, which at contract inception
represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize
deferred charges, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of
loss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claimpayments and the effects of the adjustments are included in pre-tax earnings. Significant changes in such estimates may havea significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2021, weestimate thatamortization expense in 2022 willapproximate $950 million.
Other Critical Accounting PoliciesOur Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.9 billion and
other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.5 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarterand on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more-likely-not there has been an impairment.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our
reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may
include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate andother inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and inperforming impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows andearnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of theindefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carryingvalue of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amountof goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss.K-63Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Other Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)
As of December 31, 2021, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance
Sheet was not impaired. The fair value estimates of reporting units are and will likely be significantly affected byassumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, as well as otherassumptions concerning the long-term economic performance of the reporting unit, which we cannot reliably predict.Consequently, any fair valueestimates insuch instances can besubject to wide variations.
We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key
assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capitalexpenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required inestimating the fair value of a reporting unit and inperforming goodwill impairment tests.
In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2021, the estimated fair
values of five reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting unitswas Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $34.5 billion, exceeding ourcarrying value of approximately $31.1 billion by 10.7%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5billion. For the four other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $2.5 billion, which exceededour aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.3 billion by 9.2%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill ofapproximately $1.2 billion.
In the second quarter of 2020, we quantitively reevaluated goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and
most significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 billion and
indefinite-lived intangible assetimpairment chargesof$638million,ofwhichapproximately $10billionrelatedtoPCC.
Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of PCC-related goodwill was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, thecarrying value of PCC-related indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of theseamounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The initial effects of the COVID-19pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers were particularly severe. At that time, we considered severalfactors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand,employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by manufacturers of reduced aircraft production, and the actions wewere taking or may be taking in the future to restructure operations. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailingcircumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewingfor impairments.
Market Risk Disclosures
Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to
market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currencyexchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios remain subject to considerable volatility.The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.
Equity Price RiskEquity securities represent a significant portion of our consolidated investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to
invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningfulamount in each company. Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31,2021, approximately 73% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in four companies.
We often hold our equity securities for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will
occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a
margin of safety against short-term price volatility.K-64Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)
Equity Price Risk (Continued)
We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts, although our equity price
exposure has declined significantly as a vast majority of the contracts written to date have expired. Our ultimate liability withrespect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception dateand expiration date. Thefair values of our liabilities arising from these contracts are also affected by changes inother factors.
The following table summarizes our equity securities and equity index put option contract liabilities as of
December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market pricesas of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario.Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementioned
concentrations existing i n our equity investment portfolio. Doll ar amounts are in millions.

(1)The estimated increase (decrease) is after income taxes at the statutory rate in effect as of the balance sheet date.
Interest Rate RiskWe may also invest in bonds, loans or other interest rate sensitive instruments. Our strategy is to acquire or originate
such instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinarycourse of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintainhigh credit ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rate
swaps, to manage interest raterisks and we do not attempt to match maturities of assets and liabilities.
The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and other
borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risks associated with the valuations ofour equity index put option contract liabilities are no longer considered significant due to the short duration of remainingexposures as of December 31, 2021. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increasesin fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by thecreditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrumentand other general market conditions.K-65Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and subsidiaries (the“Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income,changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and therelated notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal controlover financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
(2013)issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years inthe period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ofAmerica. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financialreporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control overfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on ouraudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities lawsand theapplicablerules and regulations of the Securitiesand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whetherdue to error or fraud, and whether effectiveinternalcontrol over financialreportingwas maintainedin all materialrespects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures
included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits
also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluatingthe overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtainingan understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testingand evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also includedperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide areasonablebasis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions anddispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary topermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts andexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of thecompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, ordisposition of thecompany’s assets thatcould have a materialeffecton the financialstatements.K-68REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC A CCOUNTING FIRM (Continued)
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequatebecause of changes in conditions,or that the degreeof compliancewith the policiesor procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statementsthat were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosuresthat are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as awhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical auditmattersor on the accountsor disclosures to which they relate.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses— Refer to Notes 1 and 16 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) under short duration property and casualtyinsurance and reinsurance contracts are $86,664 million as of December 31, 2021. The key assumptions affecting certainclaim liabilities include expected loss and expense (“loss”) ratios, expected claim count emergence patterns, expected losspaymentemergencepatterns and expectedloss reporting emergencepatterns.
Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilities
were appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2021, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent ofeffort, includingthe needto involve our actuarialspecialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit proceduresrelated to the key assumptions affectingcertainclaimliabilitiesincludedthe following, amongothers:
•We testedthe operatingeffectivenessof controls over claim liabilities, including those over the keyassumptions.
•We evaluatedthe methods and assumptions used by managementto estimatethe claim liabilities by:
•Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, such as historical claims and earned
premium, to test thatthe inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable.
•Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identify
potentialbias in thedeterminationof the claimliabilities.
•Withthe assistance of our actuarialspecialists:
•We developed independent estimates of the claim liabilities, including loss data and industry claim development
factors as needed,and comparedour estimates to management’sestimates.
•We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates to test the
reasonableness of the prior year estimates and assessed unexpecteddevelopment.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets — Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of thefair value of each reporting unit or asset to its carrying value. The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-livedintangible assets for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets forimpairment, the fair value of each reporting unit or asset is estimated. Significant judgment is required in estimating fairvalues and performing impairment tests. The Company primarily uses discounted projected future net earnings or net cash
flows and multiples of earnings to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and
assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue, earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), and discount rates. Changesin these assumptions could have asignificant impact on the fair value of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
The Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) reporting unit reported approximately $21 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived
intangible assets as of December 31, 2021. Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair valueof the PCC reporting unit and certain customer relationships with indefinite lives along with the difference between their fairvalues and carrying values, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates andassumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate required a high degree ofauditorjudgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate for the PCC
reportingunit and certain customer relationships included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including those over the
forecasts of futurerevenue and EBITand the selection of the discount rate.
•We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and EBIT by comparing prior year
forecasts to actual results in the respective years.
•We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s current revenue and EBIT forecasts by comparing the forecasts
to historical results and forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports and certain peer companies’disclosures.
•With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the valuation methodologies, the long-term growth
rates and discount rate, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of thecalculations, and developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the long-term growth rates and
discount rate selected by management.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2021
(1) Significant accounting policies and practices
(a) Nature of operations and basis of consolidation
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number of
diverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy,manufacturing, service and retailing. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and itsconsolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 25.
Information concerning business acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. We believe that
reporting the Railroad, Utilities and Energy subsidiaries separately is appropriate given the relative significance of theirlong-lived assets, capitalexpenditures and debt, which is not guaranteed by Berkshire.
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the
accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statementdate. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidatevariable interest entities (“VIE”) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that mostsignificantly affect its economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant tothe VIE or (b) hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompanyaccounts and transactions havebeen eliminated.
(b) Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements
We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States (“GAAP”) which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amountsof assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.Our estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to theinherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with theamortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, determinations of fair values of certain financialinstruments and evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment require considerablejudgment. Actual results may differ from theestimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.
The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly across the world in 2020 and was declared a pandemic by
the World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began to
significantly affect our operating businesses in March of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected nearly all
of our operations during 2020, although the effects varied significantly. The extent of the effects over longer terms onthe demand for certain of our products and services cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly,significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements including those associated with evaluations ofcertain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owedto us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts may be subject tosignificant adjustments in future periods.
(c) Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills
Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments with maturities of three
months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills consist of U.S. Treasury Bills withmaturities exceeding three months at the time of purchase and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fair
value.
(d) Investments in fixed maturity securities
We classify investments in fixed maturity securities on the acquisition date and at each balance sheet date.
Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold thesecurities to maturity. Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carriedat fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale andare carried at fair value. Substantially all of investments in fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale.We amortize the difference between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings usingthe interest method.K-76Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
(d) Investments in fixed maturity securities (Continued)
We record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities when the securities are
sold, determined on a specific identification basis. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we recognize a loss inearnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers. As of the balancesheet date, we evaluate whether the other unrealized losses are attributable to credit losses or other factors. We considerthe severity of the decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors. We record an allowancefor credit losses, limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings if thepresent value of estimated cash flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows. The allowance may besubsequently increased or decreased based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized lossthat we believe is notrelated to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income.
(e) Investments in equity securities
We carry substantially all investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fair
values in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains or losses.
(f) Investments under the equity method
We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant
influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significantinfluence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. Thispresumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercisesignificant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and other investmentswhen such investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock.
In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the
carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensiveincome of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of theinvestment. If net losses reduce our carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investmentsin the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additionalequity method losses, if any, arebased upon the change in our claim on the investee’s book value.
(g) Loans and finance receivables
Loans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to a lesser extent, commercial loans
and site-built home loans. We carry substantially all loans and finance receivables at amortized cost, net of allowancesfor expected credit losses, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loan
origination and commitment costs paid and fees received, as well as acquisition premiums or discounts, are amortized
as yield adjustments over thelives of the loans.
Prior to 2020, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailing
facts and circumstances. Beginning in 2020, measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured home loans are based on thenet present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure ofexpected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit qualityindicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateralrecovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and thehistorical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other factors. In addition, our estimates consider
currentconditions and reasonableand supportableforecasts.
Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 days
past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans arefirst applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrualonce a loan is less than 90 days delinquent.
Loans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started. Once a loan is in the process of
foreclosure, interest income is not recognized until the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modificationis complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off whenthe collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstancesconcerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan.K-77Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
(h) Other receivables
Other receivables include balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses
recoverable, as well as other receivables. Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables areprimarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination.Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatorygovernment-sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables relate to unpaid losses and loss adjustmentexpenses arising from property and casualty contracts and benefits under life and health contracts. Receivables arestated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. Prior to 2020, we recorded provisions for uncollectiblebalances when it was probable counterparties or customers would be unable to pay all amounts due based on the
contractual terms and historical loss history.
Beginning in 2020, we adopted a new accounting pronouncement that affects the measurement of allowances for
credit losses. In measuring credit loss allowances, we primarily utilize credit loss history, with adjustments to reflectcurrent or expected future economic conditions when reasonable and supportable forecasts of losses deviate fromhistorical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, we review thecredit quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other formsof credit enhancement including collateral, guarantees and other available information. We charge-off receivablesagainst the allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.
(i) Derivatives
We carry derivative contracts in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets at fair value, net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the
changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposesin earnings or, if such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities wheninclusion in regulated rates is probable.
(j) Fair value measurements
As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principalmarket exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderlymarkets in estimating fair value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances todetermine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction.
Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, and able and willing to transact an exchange and
not acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities.Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value.Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could berealized in a current or future market exchange.
(k) Inventories
Inventories consist of manufactured goods, goods or products acquired for resale and homes constructed for sale.
Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. At December 31, 2021,we used the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method to value approximately 31% of consolidated inventories with theremainder primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFO
was approximately $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.
(l) Property, plant and equipment
We record additions to property, plant and equipment used in operations at cost, which includes asset additions,
improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services aswell as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect toconstructed assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulatedoperations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost ofequity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and othercosts that do not improve the property, extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged
to expense as incurred.K-78Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
(l) Property, plant and equipment (Continued)
Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation
methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under groupdepreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences inthe service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold,no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings.
We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to the estimated salvage value
primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciableassets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years, machinery and
equipment – 3 to 25 years and furniture, fixtures and other – 3 to 15 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of
depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 yearsand locomotives, freight cars and other equipment – 6 to 43 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique toour regulated utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems –5 to 80 years, interstate natural gas pipeline assets – 3 to 80 years and independent power plants and other assets – 2 to50 years.
We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrenceof a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset andthe residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the
estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings,
except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts ofregulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value.
(m) Leases
We are party to contracts where we lease property to others (“lessor” contracts) and where we lease property
from others (“lessee” contracts). We record acquisitions of and additions to equipment that we lease to others at cost.We depreciate equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method overestimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 35 years. We use declining balance depreciation methods for assets when therevenue-earning power of the asset is greater during the earlier years of its life. We also evaluate equipment held forlease for impairmentconsistent with policies for property, plant and equipment.
When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets
represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to makelease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable paymentsthat depend on an index or rate. The lease term is generally considered the non-cancellable lease period. Certain leasecontracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage.Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that optionswill be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets aresubject to review for impairment. As permitted under GAAP, we do not separate lease components from non-leasecomponents by class of asset and do not record assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less.
(n) Goodwill and other intangible assets
Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets of
that business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, weestimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value,including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to,discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. When the carrying amount of areporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairmentloss.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes
in circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. Significant judgment is required inestimating fair values and performing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests. We amortize
intangible assets with finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on
a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed forimpairment when events orchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amountmay not be recoverable.K-79Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(o) Revenue recognition
We earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss
exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. Premiums are generally earned inproportion to the coverage provided, which is generally ratable over the term of the contract with unearned premiumscomputed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts aregenerally received in full and are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all underlying loss events covered by thepolicies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts areearned when due. Premiums for periodic payment annuity contracts are usually received in full at the inception of thecontracts. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with
experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts.
Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good or
service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on theconsiderationwe expect to receive in connection withour promises to delivergoods and services to our customers.
We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales
contracts provide customers with these products through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for considerationspecified under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices.Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts containmultiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone sellingprices of each product or service.
Sales revenue reflects reductions for returns, allowances, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which
may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenue includes certain state and local excisetaxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities.Sales revenue excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenueincludes consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control ofthe goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer assales revenue.
Our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to
the customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of thearrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, primarily from
certain castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers
continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and thecontract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach ofcontract.
The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight
from a point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading whichcreate a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for eachperformance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destinationpair and contract incentives, which are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs,interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car/unit amount to
transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the
service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenuesrecognized represent the proportion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freighttransportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, whichare primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recordedas a reductionto revenue on apro-rata basis based on actualor projectedfuture customershipments.K-80Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(o) Revenue recognition (Continued)
Our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory
commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gasand have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time asenergy is delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewableenergy business. Energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directlywith the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments fromcustomers are generally due within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are establishedby regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among
the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final
approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimatedrefunds is accrued. Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations aresatisfied over time, where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services or at a point in timewhen the services are provided. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair,aircraftmanagement,aviationtraining, franchisingand news distribution.
Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under
the terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our lessor contracts are classified as operating leases.
(p) Losses and loss adjustment expenses
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property/casualty insurance and
reinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities represent
the estimated ultimate payment amounts withoutdiscounting for time value.
We base liability estimates on (1) loss reports from policyholders and cedents, (2) individual case estimates and
(3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statementsof Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and lossadjustment expenses charged to earnings are net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable underceded reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnifypolicyholderswith respect tothe underlying insuranceand reinsurancecontracts.
(q) Retroactive reinsurance contracts
We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under short duration retroactive reinsurance
contracts consistent with property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts described in Note 1(p). With respect to
retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts, representingthe excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We subsequently amortize thedeferred charge assets over the expected claim settlement periods using the interest method. Changes to the estimatedtiming or amount of future loss payments also produce changes in deferred charge balances. We apply changes in suchestimates retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge balances, together with periodic amortization, areincluded in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.
(r) Insurance policy acquisition costs
We capitalize the incremental costs that directly relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject to
ultimate recoverability. For short duration contracts, we subsequently amortize such costs to underwriting expenses as
the related premiums are earned. Acquisition costs related to long duration life insurance contracts are amortized over
the expected premium-paying period in proportion to the anticipated premiums over the life of the policy. Suchanticipated premiums are estimated using the same assumptions used for computing liabilities for future policybenefits. Direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associatedwith successful efforts. We expense all other underwriting costs as incurred. The recoverability of capitalized insurancepolicy acquisition costs generally reflects anticipation of investment income. The unamortized balances are included inother assets and were approximately $3.4 billion and $3.25 billion atDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.K-81Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(1) Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)
(s) Life and annuity insurance benefits
We compute liabilities for benefits under life insurance contracts based upon estimated future investment yields,
expected mortality, morbidity and lapse or withdrawal rates, as well as estimates of premiums we expect to receive andexpenses we expect to incur in the future. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adversedeviation and may vary with the characteristics of the contract’s date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk.The interest rate assumptions used may vary by contract or jurisdiction. We discount periodic payment annuityliabilities based on the implicit rate as of the inception of the contracts such that the present value of the liabilitiesequals the premiums. Discount rates for most contracts range from 3% to 7%.
(t) Regulated utilities and energy businesses
Certain energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for
regulated operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs fromcustomers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process.Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities.Regulatory assets and liabilities will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods.
Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by
considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by otherregulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable ofinclusion in regulatory rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) orreturned to customers.
(u) Foreign currency
The accounts of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries are measured, in most instances, using functional currencies
other than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses in the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated intoU.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate asof the end of the reporting period. The net effects of translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries areincluded in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arisingfrom transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entity, including gainsand losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included inearnings.
(v) Income taxes
Berkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States, which includes eligible subsidiaries.
In addition, we file income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions as applicable. Provisions for currentincome tax liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the incometax returns for the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases and
tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilitiesassociated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensiveincome. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income taxexpense. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are chargedor credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred
tax assets when realization is not likely.
Assets and liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income
tax returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technicalmerits of the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a componentof incometax expense.K-82Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(w) New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2020
We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January
1, 2020. ASC 326 provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried atamortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses thereforeinclude provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, creditlosses were measured when non-collection was considered probable. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a chargeto retainedearnings of $388 millionrepresentingthe cumulativeafter-taxincreasein our allowances for creditlosses.
(x) New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2019
Berkshire adopted ASC 842 “Leases” on January 1, 2019 with respect to contracts in effect as of the adoption
and elected to not restate prior period financial statements. Most significantly, ASC 842 requires a lessee to recognize a
liability to make operating lease payments and an asset with respect to its right to use the underlying asset for the leaseterm. Upon adoption, we recorded operating lease right-of-use assets of approximately $6.2 billion, lease liabilities of$5.9 billionand reduced otherassets by approximately$300 million.
(y) New accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December 31, 2021
In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12
“Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”). ASU 2018-12 requiresreassessment of cash flow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions each reportingperiod in valuing policyholder liabilities and related deferred acquisition costs of long-duration insurance andreinsurance contracts. The effects from changes in cash flow assumptions are reflected in earnings and the effects from
changes in discount rate assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the cash flow and
discount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limitedcircumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented in the financial statements,requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoptionpermitted.
We currently intend to adopt ASU 2018-12 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method,
which provides that the revised cash flow and discount rate assumptions as of January 1, 2021 (the transition date) beapplied to contracts then in-force, with liabilities then remeasured as provided under the standard. The cumulativeeffects from discount rate assumption changes as of the transition date will be reflected in accumulated othercomprehensive income and the cumulative effect from cash flow assumption changes will be included in retained
earnings. While we have not finalized our assessment of the impact of the adoption as of the transition date, we
currently believe that the changes in discount rate assumptions will have a greater effect on our recorded liabilities thanchanges in cash flow assumptions. We also preliminarily estimate that the changes in discount rate assumptions as ofJanuary 1, 2021 will increase our life, health and annuity benefit liabilities from the amounts previously reported due tothe historically low interest rate environment at that time. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2018-12 willbe based on the discount rate and cash flow assumptions determined as of the January 1, 2023 adoption date. We,therefore, continue to evaluate the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.
(2) Business acquisitions
Our long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equity
and able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated
Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates.
Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) acquired certain businesses of Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) on
November 1, 2020, pursuant to a definitive agreement with Dominion in July 2020. The acquired businesses included naturalgas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines, natural gas storage capacity and partial ownership of a liquefied natural gasexport, import and storage facility (“Cove Point”). In October 2020, BHE and Dominion also agreed to provide for theexclusion of certain pipeline businesses from the initial agreement and entered into a second acquisition agreement withrespect to the excluded pipeline businesses. The closing of the second agreement was subject to regulatory and customaryclosing conditions;however, in July 2021, BHE andDominion agreed to terminate the second agreement.K-83Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

As part of this acquisition, BHE acquired an indirect 25% economic interest in Cove Point, consisting of 100% of the
general partnership interest and 25% of the limited partnership interests. We concluded that Cove Point is a VIE and that wehave the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance as well as the obligation toabsorb losses and receive benefits which could be significant to Cove Point. Therefore, we treat Cove Point as a consolidatedsubsidiary. Thenoncontrolling interests are attributable to the limited partner interests held by third parties.
In each of the past three years, we also completed several smaller-sized business acquisitions, which we consider as
“bolt-ons” to several of our existing business operations. We do not believe that these acquisitions are material, individually
or in the aggregate to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investments in commercial, industrial and other equity securities include our investments in Occidental Corporation
(“Occidental”), which we acquired in 2019. These investments were acquired for a total of $10 billion and consist ofOccidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $10 billion and warrants, whichcurrently permit us to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $59.62 pershare. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in2029 at a redemption price equal to 105% of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends and ismandatorily redeemable under certain specified events. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year afterthe redemption of the preferred stock.
(5) Equity method investments
Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity
method. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“KraftHeinz”). Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, includingcondiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshirecurrently owns 26.6% of the outstanding shares of Kraft Heinzcommon stock.
We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $269 million in 2021, $95 million in 2020
and $493 million in 2019. Equity method earnings included the effects of goodwill and identifiable intangible assetimpairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Our share of such charges was approximately $350 million in 2021, $850million in 2020 and $450 million in 2019. We received dividends from Kraft Heinz of $521 million in each of 2021, 2020
and 2019, which we recorded as reductions inour carrying value.
Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $11.7
billion at December 31, 2021 and $11.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The carrying value of our investment wasapproximately $13.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and $13.3 billion at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, thecarrying value of our investment exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by approximately 11% of thecarrying value. We evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances,we concluded recognition of an impairment charge in earnings was not required as of December 31, 2021.K-85Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”), Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”) and beginningin 2021, Iroquois Gas Transmission System L.P. (“Iroquois”). The aggregate carrying value of our investments in theseentities was $4.3 billion as of December31, 2021 and $4.0 billion as of December31, 2020. Our equity method earnings inthese entities were $726 million in 2021, $631 million in 2020 and $683 million in 2019. During 2021, we receiveddistributions of approximately $1.2 billion from these investees. Additional information concerning these investmentsfollows.
We own a 50% interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50% interest.
Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functions
for U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies andother financial institutions. Berkadia funds a portion of its operations through commercial paper borrowings, which arecurrently limited to $1.5 billion. On December 31, 2021, Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding was $1.47 billion.Berkadia’s commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligatedto indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. BHE subsidiaries own a 50% noncontrolling interest inETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in Texas and a 50% noncontrolling interest in Iroquois, whichowns and operates a natural gas pipeline located in New York and Connecticut.
We own a 38.6% interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers
in North America with more than 800 retail locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces and through wholesale
distribution. Pilot’s revenues in 2021 were approximately $45 billion. The Haslam family currently owns a 50.1% interest in
Pilot and a third party owns the remaining 11.3% interest. We have an agreement to acquire in 2023 an additional 41.4%interest in Pilot with the Haslam family retaining a 20% interest. As a result, Berkshire will become the majority owner ofPilot in 2023.

Equity securities gains and losses include unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair values during the year on
equity securities we still owned at the end of the year, as well as gains and losses on securities we sold during the year. Asreflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $15.8 billion in 2021, $38.8billion in 2020 and $14.3 billion in 2019 from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains and losseson equity securities sold during the year represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equitysecurities sold at the beginning of the applicable year or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains and losses on equitysecurities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable gains were $3.6 billionin 2021, $6.2 billion in 2020 and $3.2 billion in 2019.
The derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts written prior to March 2008 on
four major equity indexes. Information related to these contracts follows (dollars in millions).

We are also party to commercial loan agreements with Seritage Growth Properties (“Seritage”) and Lee Enterprises,
Inc, (“Lee”), in which loan balances aggregated $1.9 billion at December 31, 2021 and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2020.The Seritage loan is pursuant to a $2.0 billion term loan facility and the outstanding loan is secured by mortgages on its realestate properties. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the loan agreement with Seritage was amended to allow optional loanprepayments without penalty and on December 31, 2021, Seritage made a loan prepayment of $160 million. The amendmentsfurther provide Seritage with the option to extend the maturity of the loan to July 31, 2025, if the outstanding principal hasbeen reduced to $800 million by the original expiration date of July 31, 2023. The loan to Lee matures in 2045 and was madein connection with its acquisition of our newspaper operations and the repayment by Lee of its then outstanding creditfacilities. We are the sole lender to each of these entities and each of these loans is current as to payment status.

During 2020, we reevaluated goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of certain of our reporting units for
impairment due to the disruptions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, which we believed most significantly affected the
air travel, commercial aerospace and supporting industries. We recorded goodwill impairment charges of approximately $10
billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million in the second quarter of 2020. Approximately$10 billion of these charges pertained to Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), one of the largest businesses within Berkshire’smanufacturing segment. The carrying values of PCC-related goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets prior to theimpairment charges were approximately $31 billion. The impairment charges were determined based on discounted cash flowmethods and reflected our assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with the aerospace industry. Significantjudgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment tests. Due to the inherentuncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings, actual results in the future may vary significantly from theforecasts.K-90Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(15) Dividend restrictions – Insurance subsidiaries
Payments of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by insurance statutes and regulations. Without prior
regulatory approval, our principal insurance subsidiaries may declare up to approximately $30 billion as ordinary dividendsduring 2022. Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities and short-term investments on deposit with U.S. stateinsurance authorities in accordance with state insurance regulations were approximately $6.4 billion at December 31, 2021and $5.5 billion at December 31, 2020.
Combined shareholders’ equity of U.S. based insurance subsidiaries determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules
(Surplus as Regards Policyholders) was approximately $301 billion at December 31, 2021 and $237 billion at December 31,2020. Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP, due to differences in accounting for certainassets and liabilities. For instance, deferred charges reinsurance assumed, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gainson certain investments and related deferred income taxes are recognized for GAAP but not for statutory reporting purposes.In addition, the carrying values of certain assets, such as goodwill and non-insurance entities owned by our insurancesubsidiaries, are not fully recognized for statutory reporting purposes.K-91Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(16) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses
Our liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property and
casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claimoccurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. Areconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 17),for each of the three years ending December 31, 2021 is as follows (in millions).

Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to
insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accidentyears”). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. Current accident yearincurred losses included approximately $2.9 billion in 2021, $950 million in 2020 and $1.0 billion in 2019 from significantcatastrophe events (losses in excess of $100 million per event) occurring in the respective year. Current accident year
incurred losses from private passenger auto insurance also increased significantly in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due
to increased claims frequencies and severities. In 2020, current accident year incurred losses reflected low private passenger
auto claims frequencies and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and reinsurancebusiness attributable to
the COVID-19 pandemic.
We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $3.1 billion in 2021, $356
million in 2020 and $752 million in 2019, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustmentexpenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 4.0% in2021, 0.5% in 2020 and 1.1% in 2019.
Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years from primary insurance were reduced by $2.4 billion in 2021,
$518 million in 2020 and $457 million in 2019. The reductions in 2021 and 2020 derived primarily from private passenger
auto and medical professional liability claims. In both 2021 and 2020, we also lowered estimated ultimate liabilities for prior
accident years with respect to workers’ compensation claims, which were largely offset by increases in ultimate liabilities forother casualty claims. The decrease in incurred losses for prior accident years in 2019 reflected reductions in medicalprofessional liability and workers’ compensation estimates partially offset by higher other casualty estimates. Estimatedultimate liabilities for prior accident years related to property and casualty reinsurance decreased $718 million in 2021,increased $162 million in 2020 and decreased $295 million in 2019. The increase in 2020 included increased claimsestimatesfor legacy casualty exposures.K-92Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(16) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)
Estimated net claim liabilities for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures were approximately $2.1
billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. These liabilities are subject to change due to changes in the legal and regulatoryenvironment. We are unable to reliably estimate additional losses or a range of losses that are reasonably possible for theseclaims.

GEICO
GEICO’s claim liabilities predominantly relate to various types of private passenger auto liability and physical damage
claims. For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methodsand techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceivedchanges in loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case developmentand IBNR estimates.
We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims
prior to establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimates
and for large volumes of minor physical damage claims that once reported are quickly settled. We establish case loss
estimates for liability claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses, as the facts and merits of the claim areevaluated.
Claim estimates for liability coverages normally reflect greater uncertainty than physical damage coverages, primarily
due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of litigation and the time needed to evaluate facts at the time the caseestimate is first established. The “claim-tail” is the period between the claim occurrencedate and claim settlement or paymentdate. Consequently, we establish additional case development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities.For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported andunreported) for each significant coverage and deducting reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The productof the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may
record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.K-93Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

GEICO’s net incurred and paid auto physical damage and liability losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year
below. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2021. Claim counts are established when accidents thatmay result in a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage. Each claim event may generate claims under multiplecoverages, and thus may result in multiple counts. The “Cumulative Number of Reported Claims” includes the combinednumber of reportedclaimsfor all auto policycoverages. Dollars arein millions.

BH Primary
BH Primary’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses primarily derive from medical professional
liability and workers’ compensation and other casualty insurance, which includes commercial auto and general liabilityinsurance. Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year in the following tables, disaggregated bymedical professional liability coverages and workers’ compensation and other casualty coverages. IBNR and casedevelopment liabilities are as of December 31, 2021. The cumulative number of reported claims reflects the number ofindividualclaimantsand includesclaims thatultimatelyresulted in no liabilityor payment. Dollarsare in millions.
MedicalProfessional Liability
We estimate the ultimate expected incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for medical professional claim
liabilities using a variety of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies, such as the paid and incurred development method
and Bornhuetter-Ferguson based methods, as well as other techniques that consider insured loss exposures and historical andexpected loss trends, among other factors. These methodologies produce loss estimates from which we determine our bestestimate. In addition, we study developments in older accident years and adjust initial loss estimates to reflect recentdevelopments based upon claim age, coverageand litigation experience.

Workers’ Compensationand Other Casualty
We periodically evaluate ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense estimates for the workers’ compensation and other
casualty claims using a combination of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies such as the Bornhuetter-Ferguson andchain-ladder approaches using paid and incurred loss data. Paid and incurred loss data is segregated and analyzed by state dueto the different state regulatory frameworks that may impact certain factors, including the duration and amount of losspayments. We also separately study the various components of liabilities, such as employee lost wages, medical expenses andthe costs of claims investigations and administration. We establish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the factsand circumstances of the claim. The excess of the ultimate projected losses, including the expected development of caseestimates, and the case-basis liabilities is included in IBNR liabilities.

BHRG
We use a variety of methodologies to establish BHRG’s estimates for property and casualty claims liabilities. These
methodologies include paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Fergusontechniques and frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate.
Our claims liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development and IBNR
liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported under our contracts either individually or in bulk as provided under the
terms of the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemedappropriate, we may establish case liabilities based on our estimates.K-96Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)
(16) Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)
Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which are
evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Estimated case and IBNRliabilities for major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated withthe individual loss event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or isotherwise considered unreliable.
Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorter
claim-tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage canapply to multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the cedingcompany may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and
casualty coverages based on internal estimates. BHRG’s disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized
by accident year. IBNR and case developmentliabilities are as of December 31, 2021. Dollars are in millions.

(17) Retroactive reinsurance contracts
Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration
insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Claims paymentsmay commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has beenreached. Reconciliations of the changes in estimated liabilities for retroactive reinsurance unpaid losses and loss adjustmentexpenses (“claim liabilities”) and related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets for each of the three years endedDecember 31, 2021 follow (in millions).

In the preceding table, classifications of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on the inception dates
of the contracts, which reflect when our exposures to losses began. We do not believe that analysis of losses incurred andpaid by accident year of the underlying event is relevant or meaningful given that our exposure to losses incepts when thecontract incepts. Further, we believe the classifications of reported claims and case development liabilities have little or nopractical analytical value.
Currently, our largest retroactive reinsurance contract is between our subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, and
certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). Our estimated unpaid claim liabilities withregard to the AIG contract were approximately $15.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and $17.7 billion at December31, 2020.Claim payments under this contract commenced in 2021 and were $1.2 billion during 2021. Deferred charges related to the
AIG contractwere approximately$4.5 billion atDecember 31, 2021 and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2020.
Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to contracts written in prior years were $845 million in 2021,
$907 million in 2020 and $1,188 million in 2019, which included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect ofchanges inthe timing andamount of expectedfuture loss payments.
In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and
project losses into the future under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very long for manycontracts, with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports andother information concerning the underlying losses. We reassess and revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimatelosses periodically or when significant events are revealed through our monitoring and review processes.
Estimated claim liabilities for retroactive reinsurance included estimates for environmental, asbestos and other latent
injury exposures of approximately $12.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and $12.5 billion at December 31, 2020. Retroactive
reinsurance contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and thus, our exposure to such claims under thesecontracts is likewise limited. We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and other latent injury claims.Changing laws or government regulations, newly identified toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, newcontract interpretations and other factors could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results ofoperations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonablypossible.K-99Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Borrowings  of BHFC, a wholly owned  finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist  of senior unsecured notes used to fund 
manufactured housing  loans  originated  or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC  borrowings 
are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In 2021, BHFC repaid $750 million of maturing senior notes and 
issued $750 million of 2.5%  senior notes  due in 2051.
The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€6.9 billion, £1.75  billion and
¥785.5 billion par) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreign
currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrativeexpenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $1.3 billion in 2021, pre-tax losses of $1.0 billion in
2020 and pre-tax gains of $192 million in 2019.
Berkshire also guarantees debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $3.8 billion at December 31, 2021.

We file income tax returns in the United States and in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. We have settled income tax
liabilities with the U.S. federal taxing authority (“IRS”) for tax years through 2011. The U.S. federal income tax returns from2012 through 2019 remain open, and tax years 2014 through 2019 are under audit. We are also under audit or subject to auditwith respect to income taxes in many state and foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that certain of these income taxexaminations will be settled in 2022. We currently do not believe that the outcome of unresolved issues or claims will be
material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
At December 31, 2021 and 2020, net unrecognized tax benefits were $1,046 million and $1,113 million, respectively.
Included in the balance at December 31, 2021, were $878 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact theeffective tax rate. The remaining balance in net unrecognized tax benefits principally relates to tax positions where theultimate recognition is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of recognition. Because of the impact ofdeferred income tax accounting, these positions, when recognized, would not affect the annual effective income tax rate.Other differences, net included expense of $60 million in 2020 and $377 million in 2019 for uncertain tax positions related toinvestments by a subsidiary in certain tax equity investment funds that generated income tax benefits from 2015 through2018. We concluded it was more likely than not those income tax benefits are not valid. We do not expect any materialincreases to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits during 2022.K-102Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

(20) Fair value measurements (Continued)
The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The
hierarchyfor measuring fair valueconsists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below.
Level1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted pricesfor identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets.
Level2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices
for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities
exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets orliabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and defaultrates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or othermeans. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for
instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of
the issuer or entitiesin thesame industry sector.
Level3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is
required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the
assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs requiremanagement to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by marketparticipants in valuing assets or liabilities.
Reconciliations of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2021 follow (in millions).

Investments in equity securities in the preceding table include our investments in certain preferred and common stock
warrants that do not have readily determinable market values as defined under GAAP. These investments are subject tocontractual restrictions on transferability and contain provisions that currently prevent us from economically hedging ourinvestments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regardingthe expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stockwarrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the model are observable, we made assumptionsregardingthe expectedduration and volatilityof the warrants.

Each Class A common share is entitled to one vote per share. Class B common stock possesses dividend and
distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common
share possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwiserequired under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share ofClass A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class Bcommon stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were1,477,429 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 1,543,960 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020.
Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class Bshares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A sharesoutstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares
outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times
average Class A shares outstanding.
Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that
Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of theBoard, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The programcontinues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify amaximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value ofBerkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. The repurchase programdoes not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is noexpiration date tothe program.K-105Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

See Note 20 for a discussion of the three levels of fair value measurements. Plan assets are generally invested with the
long-term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent levelof risk. Allocations may change due to changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates ofreturn on plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected long-term investment returns. Generally, past investmentreturns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on planassets. Actualexperience will differ from theassumed rates of return.K-108Notes toConsolidated Financial Statement s(Continued )

(25) Business segment data
Our operating businesses include a large and diverse group of insurance, manufacturing, service and retailing
businesses. We organize our reportable business segments in a manner that reflects how management views those businessactivities. Certain businesses are grouped together for segment reporting based upon similar products or product lines,marketing, selling and distribution characteristics, even though those business units are operated under separate localmanagement.
The tabular information that follows shows data of reportable segments reconciled to amounts reflected in our
Consolidated Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when managementconsiders those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments. Furthermore, our management does notconsider investment and derivative gains/losses, impairments or amortization of certain business acquisition accountingadjustments related to Berkshire’s business acquisitions or certain other corporate income and expense items in assessing the
financial performance of operating units. Collectively, these items are included in reconciliations of segment amounts to
consolidated amounts.

(26) Contingencies and Commitments
We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal
actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by
Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and
routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of itssubsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to imposefines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have amaterial effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.
Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business for the future purchase of goods and
services used in their businesses, which are not yet reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significantof our long-term commitments relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses and our shared aircraft ownership andleasing business. As of December 31, 2021, estimated future payments under those arrangements were as follows: $8 billionin 2022, $4 billion in 2023, $3 billion in 2024, $2 billion in 2025, $2 billion in 2026 and $15 billion after 2026.
As indicated in Note 5, we have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% ownership interest in Pilot in 2023. At
that time, Pilot will become a consolidated subsidiary. Additionally, we may be obligated to acquire certain noncontrollinginterests in less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries in the future, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the noncontrollingshareholders. The timing and the amount of any future payments that might be required to such noncontrolling shareholdersare contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners and the value of the interest being acquired. If we had acquiredthe additional interest in Pilot and all outstanding noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2021, we estimate theaggregate cost of these acquisitions would approximate $11 billion.K-113Item 9.

A-2BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.
To the Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.:
Warren has asked me to provide a summary of Berkshire’s actions related to sustainability within its
operating companies. The management of these actions is owned by Berkshire’s exceptional operating CEOs.Under their leadership, and with my support, many of Berkshire’s diverse businesses have developedsustainability frameworks and are independently disclosing environmental initiatives and data, such asgreenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions.
Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) and Burlington Northern Santa Fe (“BNSF”) – two of Berkshire’s
giants – have long been engaged in delivering sustainable outcomes that benefit all constituencies includingcustomers, communities, state and federal governments and Berkshire’s shareholders. The two businessesgenerated aggregate net earnings of $10.0 billion in 2021 and their direct GHG emissions represent more than90% of Berkshire’s direct emissions – a huge margin. Other subsidiaries, of course, are important, but Berkshirewill have failed if BHE and BNSF do not achieve their GHG emissions reduction goals.
Here are the annual GHG emissions from these two businesses:
Annual GHG Emissions
(million metric tons)
Company Baseline 20212030
Target
B H E...................................... 79.9 63.5 39.9
BNSF ..................................... 18.6 15.8 13.0
98.5 79.3 52.9
BHE has selected 2005 as its baseline for GHG emissions – a year many others in the utility industry utilize.
BHE’s primary source of GHG emissions is the generation of electricity from power plants that are fueled bycoal and natural gas. BHE’s utilities work with their regulators to implement state policies that protect the energyand economic needs of its constituents. BHE cannot develop a renewable energy project or retire a coal plantwithout the support of regulators, who ensure that any action taken by BHE is made in the best interest ofcustomers.
I am pleased to report that BHE’s ability to make significant investments in renewables has created the
opportunity to actively reduce coal generation while maintaining reliability and keeping customer costs low inthe process.
Specifically, BHE has become a leading force in wind, solar and transmission activity across much of the
U.S. BHE, through its Iowa utility MidAmerican Energy, began construction of its first wind turbines in 2004,investing a little over $300 million in these assets. Today, MidAmerican has over 3,400 turbines in operation andhas invested $13.6 billion in wind production. This incredible expenditure helps MidAmerican to producerenewable energy equivalent to 88% of its Iowa customers’ annual energy needs. It is attracting new customerstoo – data center activity is growing exponentially throughout Iowa, driven by MidAmerican’s combination oflow cost and clean power. This is not the end of MidAmerican’s journey – just last month, the companyannounced plans for a new $3.9 billion wind and solar project, which will enable renewable generation in excessof its customers’ annual usage in Iowa by 2025.
The commitment to renewables goes beyond Iowa. In addition to the $13.6 billion invested in wind at
MidAmerican, BHE has invested $16.5 billion in other wind, solar and geothermal energy projects that itoperates and has financed an additional $6.9 billion for other operators.
A-3While making these significant investments in renewables, BHE has retired 16 of its coal generation units.
Looking ahead, BHE plans to retire an additional 16 coal units between 2022 and 2030 in a reliable and cost-effectivemanner for its customers, thereby achieving its 50% GHG emissions reduction target for 2030. Progress has beenconsistent with this objective.
Simultaneously, BHE plans to invest billions of dollars in wind, solar and storage capacity, as well as invest in
new transmission lines in the West – a story told in Berkshire’s 2020 annual report. These transmission linesconnect remote noncarbon resources to far-away population centers. As additional noncarbon generation isdeployed and transmission is expanded, BHE plans to retire all remaining coal units by 2049 and all natural gasunits by 2050, enabling it to achieve net zero GHG emissions.
BHE routinely communicates in detail its approach to decarbonization, outlining its strategies and the capital it
will deploy to achieve this objective. BHE’s regulated U.S. utilities issue third-party debt as part of their capitalstructure. Consequently, BHE has made environmental disclosures every year for the past 15 years through investorpresentations. These documents are publicly available on BHE’s website.
BNSF has selected 2018 as its GHG emissions baseline year, which is consistent with its largest peer in the
West. BNSF’s GHG emissions profile is comprised of the consumption of diesel fuel in its locomotives (accountingfor 80% of its baseline GHG emissions), the third-party production and transportation of those fuels and, to a lesserextent, the consumption of natural gas and electricity across its broader operations.
BNSF is a common carrier railroad with a federal legal obligation to transport any commodity – including coal
and hazardous materials – upon its customers’ request. Yet, the environmental impacts of the transportation of thesegoods are reduced thanks to BNSF’s focus on safety and efficiency. By nature, rail is the most environmentallyefficient mode of land-based transportation, moving its customers’ products more than three times as far as truckson a per ton mile basis. To build on this, BNSF has committed to and embraced a broader sustainability model,applying a science-based approach that will provide a 30% reduction in BNSF’s GHG emissions by 2030 asmeasured from its baseline. Progress has been consistent with this objective.
More will follow. Berkshire’s railroad will continue its improvements in fuel efficiency and increase its
utilization of renewable diesel fuel. Long-term solutions, such as battery-electric and hydrogen locomotives, arealso being evaluated and field tested. When successful, these measures will lower BNSF’s GHG emissions andincrease its cost competitiveness. Sustainability is fundamental to BNSF’s value proposition.
BHE and BNSF are not alone when it comes to these sustainability endeavors at Berkshire. Many subsidiaries
have also been responding to their customers’ varied needs by carrying out commitments to sustainable outcomesand communicating environmental information. Equally, these efforts make good business sense.
For example, many consumers are interested in improved environmental outcomes for apparel products. As a
result, three of Berkshire’s manufacturing businesses that specialize in these products – Fruit of the Loom, BrooksSports and Garan – each disclose the environmental impacts of the products they sell and their plans to reduce thoseimpacts long term. Further, all three businesses have committed to 2030 GHG emissions reduction targets,consistent with the expectations of each customer base. This information can be found on their websites.
Additionally, four manufacturing businesses across Berkshire’s industrial and building products groups –
Lubrizol, Johns Manville, Acme Brick and Shaw Industries – disclose on their websites recent GHG emissions dataand other sustainability information that is most relevant to their customers and operations.
Berkshire’s culture is strong, and its operating managers daily demonstrate ownership and accountability by
being responsive to the needs of their customers. The managers of these subsidiaries will continue to own allbusiness decisions, including their approach to sustainability and related environmental outcomes. Berkshire’sbusinesses are exceptionally well positioned to deliver on ever-changing customer expectations regardingsustainability, in both resources and attitude, while also driving value for Berkshire’s shareholders. I am supportiveof these outlined objectives and fully committed to Berkshire’s ongoing journey of delivering sustainable solutions.

PROPERTY/CASUALTY INSURANCE*
Our property/casualty (“P/C”) insurance business has been the engine propelling Berkshire’s growth since 1967, the year we acquired
National Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest P/C company inthe world as measured by net worth. Insurance is a business of promises, and Berkshire’s ability to honor its commitments is unmatched.
One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry’s business model: P/C insurers receive premiums upfront and pay
claims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severe workplace accidents, payments can stretch over
many decades.
This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others.
Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float aninsurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how it
has grown, as the following table shows:
Year Float (in millions)
1970 ............................................................ $ 3 9
1980 ............................................................ 2 3 7
1990 ............................................................ 1,632
2000 ............................................................ 27,871
2010 ............................................................ 65,832
2018 ............................................................ 122,732
2019 ............................................................ 129,423
We may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual – at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The
nature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to
our cash resources. That structure is by design and is a key component in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. That
strength will never be compromised.
If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers an underwriting profit that adds to
the investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money – and, better yet, get paid for holding
it.
For the P/C industry as a whole, the financial value of float is now far less than it was for many years. That’s because the standard
investment strategy for almost all P/C companies is heavily – and properly – skewed toward high-grade bonds. Changes in interest rates
therefore matter enormously to these companies, and during the last decade the bond market has offered pathetically low rates.
Consequently, insurers suffered, as year by year they were forced – by maturities or issuer-call provisions – to recycle their “old”
investment portfolios into new holdings providing much lower yields. Where once these insurers could safely earn 5 cents or 6 cents on eachdollar of float, they now take in only 2 cents or 3 cents (or even less if their operations are concentrated in countries mired in the never-neverland of negative rates).
Some insurers may try to mitigate their loss of revenue by buying lower-quality bonds or non-liquid “alternative” investments promising
higher yields. But those are dangerous games and activities that most institutions are ill-equipped to play.
Berkshire’s situation is more favorable than that of insurers in general. Most important, our unrivaled mountain of capital, abundance of
cash and a huge and diverse stream of non-insurance earnings allow us far more investment flexibility than is generally available to othercompanies in the industry. The many choices open to us are always advantageous – and sometimes have presented us with major
opportunities.
Our P/C companies have meanwhile had an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 16 of
the last 17 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was a whopping $3.2 billion. For the entire 17-year span, our pre-tax gaintotaled $27.5 billion, of which $400 million was recorded in 2019.
That record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, who know that the rewards of float
can be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.
As I have repeatedly done in the past, I will emphasize now that happy outcomes in insurance are far from a sure thing: We will most
certainly not have an underwriting profit in 16 of the next 17 years. Danger always lurks.
Mistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years – even decades – to surface and ripen. (Think asbestos.) A
major catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael willoccur – perhaps tomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. “The Big
One” may come from a traditional source, such as wind or earthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving, say, a cyber attack havingdisastrous consequences beyond anything insurers now contemplate. When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, Berkshire will get its share of thelosses and they will be big – very big. Unlike many other insurers, however, handling the loss will not come close to straining our resources,
and we will be eager to addto our business the next day.
